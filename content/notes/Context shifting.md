# Context shifting
Date created: 2022-06-02

**Context shifting** is when your attention moves focus, often triggered by an external event like an incoming email or a colleague passing by your office.

It can have detrimental effects on your focus and the quality of work, since it is often hard to move back instantly. There is [[Attention residue]] and there may be "open loops" from what you just saw that nags in the back of your mind.

[[Time management]] and more specifically timeblock planning is a way to reduce the amount of context shifting you experience during a typical workday. When you work on a single task at a time, the quality will improve dramatically.

As a common source of context shifting, a lot of authors are now arguing that we should reduce or completely stop using social media platforms so much. [[Your attention didn't collapse. It was stolen]] and [[In the day of the postman]] argue this point, we need solitude and space to think.
