# Junior academics and influencers obsess over metrics
Date created: 2022-06-14

As a junior academic you want to prove yourself worthy and chase metrics like citation counts and h-index. Influencers are much the same, trying to increase their following and impact.

[[Job insecurity can in part explain why academics chase influencer status]]

However one potential drawback is the [[Opportunity cost]] of not [[Measure what is meaningful, not what is easy]], because if you chase these things you might end up doing worse research which will hurt you in the long term. Since academics are content creators, we should remember that [[Depth over width is the path forward for content creators]].
