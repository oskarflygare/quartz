# When the stakes of a decision are high, slowing down becomes more important
Date created: 2022-06-21

While it often feels important to come to a quick decision, if you are able to slow down you can review the decision (which reasons are compelling, why? who will be affected?) and [[Ask for help]]. Both will help you make a better decision in the end.

> You won't be judged on how quickly you decide; you will be judged by the consequences of your decision that appear in the hours, days, weeks, months, and years after you decide.

He also mentions that a good sign that you have arrived at a decision is that you can explain your reasoning to others and that they accept that reasoning. It's a version of the [[Feynman technique]].
