# Exponential backoff between connection attempts is patient while not wasting time
Date created: 2022-08-04

If you use [[Exponential backoff]] as a general strategy, you will not waste time but at the same time don't have to give up.

If someone doesn't respond to an invitation, contact again in 1 week then 2, 4, 8, 16 and so on.

> It offers a way to have finite patience and infinite mercy.
