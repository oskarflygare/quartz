Personal knowledge management is the intersection between _personal information management_ (e.g., how you remind yourself to complete tasks) and _knowledge management_ (free flow of information within an organisation). It's about collecting, understanding, and connecting new information with an emphasis on the latter two.

There are few formal PKM systems (but see [[Zettelkasten]]) and most people make their own flavour. Mindmaps, notebooks, journaling techniques etc are all forms of PKM.

- [[Collector's fallacy]]
- [[Second brain]]
- [[PARA system]]
- [[Evergreen Notes]]
- [[A PKM should foster the creation and linking of atomic notes]]
- [[Design your notes to have value long-term]]
	- [[Notes can incubate in a PKM and be discovered later]]
		- BUT [[The bottleneck of creative work is not idea generation but execution]]
	- [[Tools like a PKM are only valuable if you add things that resonate]]
	- [[The value of a linked database of notes builds up over time]]
		- [[Those with a personal knowledge database will be able to tailor AI-tools to fit their needs]]
		- [[your information diet impacts your development]]
- [[If you view your PKM as a garden, you realize maintenance is important]]
- [[Friction in a note-taking system isnt necessarily bad]]
- [[The medium you use to consume information directs the way you view the world]]
	- [[Diversity in information input will help you generate new ideas]]
