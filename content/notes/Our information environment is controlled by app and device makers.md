# Our information environment is controlled by app and device makers
Date created: 2022-07-14

And because they control it, they can exploit the environment for their own economic or political purposes.

Just like [[Your attention didn't collapse. It was stolen]] argues, we shouldn't be too hard on ourselves if this makes it hard to focus.

> Our information environment and space of action overall is increasingly owned and curated by an expert elite for political and commercial effect, with enough gated access to productivity, society, and bureaucracy to keep us dependent and unable to unplug. In concrete terms, most of what it does is deliver a steady stream of pornography, entertaining memes, political slogans, and commercial advertisements. There is no health in it, nor in us who worship at its altar.
