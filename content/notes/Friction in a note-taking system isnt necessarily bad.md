# Friction in a note-taking system isnt necessarily bad
Date created: 2022-05-15

Since we are interested in doing more things than just catalouging (it’s more than an archive), some friction may be useful. We wan’t to engage actively with the material in [[Personal Knowledge Management]]. Also, [[Friction forces you to slow down and reflect]]

This reminds me of the laptops vs pen-and-paper approach to note-taking in class, where there is evidence that pen-and-paper beats laptops in learning. Some friction (lower speed) means that you have to critically think about what to capture not, which reduces the risk of [[Collector's fallacy]].

Another interesting similartity is with the inhibitory learning approach, where desirable difficulties in exposures may actually be valuable for long-term learning.
