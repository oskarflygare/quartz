## Psychological explanations

- Inflated personal responsibility and the overestimation of threat
- Perfectionism and intolerance of uncertainty
- Over-importance of one’s thoughts and need to control thoughts

## Network theory

## Computational model
- A bayesian analysis of compulsions that aims to connect the habit theory and harm reduction models - [[fradkin2023|How computational psychiatry can advance the understanding and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder]].

> Compulsions can be both attempts to reduce overestimated threat, and expressions of inflexible habits. Both proximal causes stem from the same core impairment (unreliable predictive models) and differentiating them becomes a question of context (e.g., some contexts encourage habit formation more than others), rather than a theoretical stance.

# Treatment of OCD

## Pharmacological treatments

8 patients received Ketamine, 50% responded at 1-week follow-up - [[Rodriguez2013 - Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial of Ketamine in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Proof-of-Concept]]
