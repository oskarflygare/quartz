# Let song ideas build up over time, and work on those that accrue the most
Date created: 2021-12-13

The way Amanda Shires writes songs is to leave small post-it notes all around the house on different ideas she has. Initially she writes them down in a notebook and then extracts ideas onto the post-it cards. She adds them to different piles depending on the theme or topic, and once a pile has "grown" she will start working on converting them into songs.

This is extremely similar to the [[Zettelkasten]] method.
