# AI-generated content will flood the internet and will drown out any signal in an onslaught of noise
Date created: 2023-01-12

Innovations like ChatGPT and image-generators like DALL-E means that it's now possible to generate an infinite number of articles, emails, blog posts and tweets that are hard or impossible to distinguish from human-generated things.

Since these models are trained on what's already on the internet like SEO-optimised fluff, they will sound like that.

We're on the brink of having an even worse [[Signal versus noise]] ratio on the Internet when trying to find information.

> Many people will say we already live in this reality. We've already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of “optimised content” designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.

> But I think the sheer volume and scale of what's coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we're unprepared. Or at least, I am.

For ourselves, we will have to prove we are not bots and AI! It's the reverse [[Turing test]].
