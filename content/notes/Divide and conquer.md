# Divide and conquer
Date created: 2022-04-18

In computer science its a strategy to break down problems into smaller constituents which are solvable. It's also the basis for various [[Sorting]] algorithms like [[Mergesort]].

In politics and sociology it's a strategy to break down sources of power into smaller parts, usually by creating divisions among members of the same group. So when Russia interfered in the 2016 elections by boosting Donald Trump content, the strategy was (partly) to sow divisions among the american public and create instability.
