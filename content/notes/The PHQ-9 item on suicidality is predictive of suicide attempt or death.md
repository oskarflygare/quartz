# The PHQ-9 item on suicidality is predictive of suicide attempt or death
Date created: 2023-07-19


> Cumulative risk of suicide attempt over one year increased from .4% among outpatients reporting thoughts of death or self-harm “not at all” to 4% among those reporting thoughts of death or self-harm “nearly every day.”

So almost a 10-fold increase, but still low absolute risk estimates.
