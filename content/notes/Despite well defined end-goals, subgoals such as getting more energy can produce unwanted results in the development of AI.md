# Despite well defined end-goals, [[subgoals]] such as getting more energy can produce unwanted results in the development of AI
Date created: 2023-07-11

> “Well, here’s a [[Subgoal]] that almost always helps in biology: get more energy. So the first thing that could happen is these robots are going to say, ‘Let’s get more power. Let’s reroute all the electricity to my chips.’ Another great subgoal would be to make more copies of yourself. Does that sound good?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h02v2n2a190vqtgf4kvwm6a2))
