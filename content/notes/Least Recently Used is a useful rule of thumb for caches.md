# Least Recently Used is a useful rule of thumb for caches
Date created: 2022-07-18

When your cache is full, evicting the items that have gone the longest untouched performs well. In the worst case scenario it will take twice as long to find the item as the optimal "clairvoyant" algorithm.

When clearing your wardrobe, it's helpful to use the same strategy: "When was the last time I wore it or used it?"
