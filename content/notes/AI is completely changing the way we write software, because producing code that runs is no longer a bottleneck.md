My own experience with GitHub Copilot is that it is already way better than me at writing R code, and luckily I have enough previous knowledge to double-check that it does things accurately.

## Once production is removed as a bottleneck, what will be sought after?
- [[Taste Will Be the Most Important Skill in the Age of AI]]
- [[Meta-tasks and oversight over software will be the new skills in demand rather than writing code]]

> As software gets easier to make, itâ€™ll proliferate; programmers will be tasked with its design, its configuration, and its maintenance.
