# Preserving optionality
Date created: 2022-03-21

Keep your choices open and fluid, don't make choices before you have gotten rid of uncertainties.

It's often very useful in projects where you don't want to be "locked in" with just one vendor or strategy, because you might be wrong and want to change down the road.
