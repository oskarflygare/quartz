# One sign that you are well suited for a role is that you enjoy the processes involved
Date created: 2023-07-10

I think this can be cultivated as well. Of course you enjoy things that you have a natural aptitude for, but if you invest in learning core skills needed in your job they will become more interesting and enjoyable as well.

> One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.
