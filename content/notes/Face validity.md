# Face validity
Date created: 2021-08-18

There is a phenomenological similarity between two things.

Look for specificity: is this similarity true for the specifing thing you are measuring, or is it true for multiple things. For example, do you measure symptoms specific to a disorder or is it true for multiple disorders. Is there a [[Zone of rarity]] where symptoms are expressed in one, but not the other disorder?
