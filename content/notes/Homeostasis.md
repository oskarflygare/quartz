# Homeostasis
Date created: 2022-05-19

It’s the steady state of internal conditions maintained in a living system, for example the body. We want homeostasis in terms of body temperature, blood sugar level, fluid balance etc.

It’s like cruise control on your car. To maintain the speed, the car might have to increase throttle going uphill or brake going downhill. So there needs to be feedback loops and some sort of sensors.

In a non-biological system we call the same thing a [[Steady state]].
