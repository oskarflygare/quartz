# Breaking the fourth wall
Date created: 2022-05-31

Itâ€™s when actors or other performers directly address the audience or refer to the play as a play.

I listened to an interesting Radiolab episode about wrestling and how performers in the 90s started to blur the boundary between the performance and reality.

Fleetwood Mac are interesting because we have the chance to see something authentic behind the facade. Singing songs about heartbreak from a partner, *while playing with that person*.

I also remember Kevin Spacey doing this often on House of Cards with a great dramatic effect.
