# Network effects in communities means the value of new users increases quadratically (n^2)
Date created: 2022-06-17

Because the value comes from having a platform where "everyone" is (Facebook), or the platform "where news happen" (Twitter). It's essentially relying on the users to create content and interact with each other.

[[When social media platforms emphasized news feeds instead of interactions between users, they lost value from network effects]]
