# Commitment makes good things better and bad things worse
Date created: 2022-07-14

Quote from James Clear newsletter. It reminded me about a comment someone had made about relationships during the pandemic. The pandemic is "making good relationships better and bad relationships worse", the pressure is higher.

> The more "all-in" you are on a good relationship, the better it becomes. The more you commit to a toxic relationship, the deeper you get trapped.Â 

> The more you invest yourself in fulfilling work, the more your effort fuels you. The harder you work on a bad project or in an unsatisfying role, the more of a grind it becomes."
