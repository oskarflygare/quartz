# Discounting
Date created: 2021-10-19

What is the value of $100 received a year from now, 10 years, 100 years etc? If I would get the money right now instead I would be able to put the money to work and make it grow, so I need to do some kind of *discounting* for the future payout.

Decision makers can use discounting to estimate the future impact of decisions as well, since you can replace money with another entity.
