# Sometimes you need to remove barriers instead of continuing to improve your product
Date created: 2021-11-05

The example given was a furniture seller who had highly customisable products. The customers loved it but didn't do the purchase. Why? It was not because the product was bad, materials were subpar, or marketing was not sharp enough. *They didn't know what to do with their current furniture*.

So instead of improving the product, they needed to remove an important barrier. When they offered to pick up old furniture while dropping off the new, sales increased rapidly.
