This brings you clarity and allows you to ask of every sentence whether it serves that purpose or not. *Know your purpose*.

> A good piece of writing has a single, sharp, overriding purpose.  Every part of the writing --- even the digressions! --- should serve that purpose.  Put another way, clarity of overall purpose is an absolute requirement in a good piece of writing.
