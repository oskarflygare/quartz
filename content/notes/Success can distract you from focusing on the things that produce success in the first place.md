# Success can distract you from focusing on the things that produce success in the first place
Date created: 2022-08-05

This is a quote from [[Essentialism]]:

> Put another way, success can distract us from focusing on the essential things that produce success in the first place.

This very much applies to my work since [[Success in academia leads to outside demands on your time and focus]]. Counteract this tendency by going back to the essential.
