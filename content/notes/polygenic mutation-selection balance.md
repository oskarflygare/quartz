# polygenic mutation-selection balance
Date created: 2022-06-09

It’s the phenomenon that explains why genetic variation associated with mental disorders persists despite lowered evoluationary fitness.

Given that mental disorders are caused by many (hundreds or thousands) of genetic variations, and that only a sufficient amount of them results in a disorder, there is a balance between the chance of *mutation* (one SNP changing to a risk allele) and *selection* (lower evolutionary fitness).
