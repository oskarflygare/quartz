# Realism
Date created: 2021-08-16

## Realism in science
Assumes that the content of science is real in a way that is independent of human conceptions and activities.

"It is the common sense position accepted by most working biomedical scientists, who, if asked about the nature of the subject of their studies, would reply: "Of course, the things I work on are real. What a silly question!"."

Kenneth Kendler thinks a biological flavor of realism is apprioriate for psychiatric disorders. *We do not "create" our disorders; rather we find them in nature.*
