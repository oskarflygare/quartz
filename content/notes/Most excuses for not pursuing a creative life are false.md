# Most excuses for not pursuing a creative life are false
Date created: 2022-06-21

There are so many things that take up our time during the day that we don't actually need. *Especially* time spent looking at your smartphone!

So finding time to do creative things usually means giving up some trivial activity, and a grand change in your life (new job, moving, kids growing up) is typically not needed.

I think the critique resonates well with [[In the day of the postman]] and underscores that [[Context shifting]] is really bad for creative output.

> Then I bring up the bad news: You have to make time to do this.
> 
> This means you have to grasp that your manic forms of connectivity—cell phone, email, text, Twitter—steal most chances of lasting connection or amazement. That multitasking can argue a wasted life. That a close friendship is worth more than material success.

> This is what I say: First of all, no one needs to watch the news every night, unless one is married to the anchor. Otherwise, you are mostly going to learn more than you need to know about where the local fires are, and how rainy it has been: so rainy! That is half an hour, a few days a week, I tell my students. You could commit to writing one page a night, which, over a year, is most of a book.
