# bean counting
Date created: 2021-09-25

The tendency to count easy metrics rather than the important, but harder to measure, ones. I see it in academia where you often count the number of first/last author papers or h-value or impact factor. Whether or not the research is actually *important* is much harder to find out.

> Why are universities overrun by metrics? Are we heading for a world where we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing?
