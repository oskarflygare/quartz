# Double debt
Date created: 2022-06-07

When you take out a loan to pay another loan or other debt. This happened in Haiti when the French required reparations after Haiti's independence.

It can also be a negative economic spiral when someone is in credit card debt, and then uses another credit card to pay off the first debt.
