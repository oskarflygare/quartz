# Once voters are engaged with one question, political operatives can turn their attention to other issues
Date created: 2022-05-09

In the late 1970s, conservative political operatives in the US used an issue the evangelicals cared about (semi-segregated school taxes) to "activate" them for other questions, like abortion. Interestingly, the political operative tried to engage the evangelicals with multiple issues before getting some traction with the school reform issue.

This was a group that wasn't very politically active prior to this. Wake them from their political slumber.

Ronald Reagan became the presidential candidate to really endorse abortion more than previous conservative politicians, and it was a part of his successful bid for president.
