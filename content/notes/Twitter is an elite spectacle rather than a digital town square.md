# Twitter is an elite spectacle rather than a digital town square
Date created: 2022-05-10

The most extreme groups on twitter and other [[Social media]] have an outsized influence on the platform, and this pushes people in leadership into abrupt changes that are endorsed by just a small fraction and not representative.

> As haidt emphasizes, these two groups are also the whitest and richest of those studied, meaning that Twitter's increasingly heated wrangling is not just far from a considered democratic debate but has truly become a spectacle driven by a narrow and unrepresentative group of elites.

Twitter is an elite spectacle rather than a digital town square.

> The problem is not how these games are played but the fact that so many people in positions of power keep taking them seriously
