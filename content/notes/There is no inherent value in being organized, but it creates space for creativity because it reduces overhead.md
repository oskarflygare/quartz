# There is no inherent value in being organized, but it creates space for creativity because it reduces overhead
Date created: 2022-07-06

You can get things out of your head and focus just on the task ahead of you, instead of worrying about what to do next or appointments etc.

Being organized and efficient reduces overhead: the shuffling papers, scheduling, and other maintenance tasks you do to organize your work projects.

> When we are organized and efficient, that creates space for creativity to arise. When we have confidence in our creative process, we don’t have to think about it as much, significantly reducing the background stress of constantly worrying whether we’re going in the right direction.
