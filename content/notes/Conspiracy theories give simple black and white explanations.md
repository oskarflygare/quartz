[[Conspiracy theories]] give simple black and white explanations

This is a very appealing characteristic to explain complex or terrifying events. They also often include explanations that put the blame on someone else: the global elite, corrupt government officials, others in power, etc. So it's not your fault.

This reminds me of [[Rumination]] because there, too, you can comfortably put the blame for negative things on someone else.
