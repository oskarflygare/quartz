Amateurs often make mistakes, so if you're playing a game at an amateur level you have a lot to gain by just reducing your own unforced mistakes and playing safe. Then you will let your opponent "beat themselves".

>  … if you choose to win at tennis – as opposed to having a good time – the strategy for winning is to avoid mistakes. The way to avoid mistakes is to be conservative and keep the ball in play, letting the other fellow have plenty of room in which to blunder his way to defeat, because he, being an amateur will play a losing game and not know it.
