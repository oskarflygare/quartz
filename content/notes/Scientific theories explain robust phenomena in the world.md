# Scientific theories explain robust phenomena in the world
Date created: 2022-12-01

A lot of energy in the reproducibility movement is being put into ensuring that we have robust phenomena to observe.

The things that we try to identify is called the *Target system*, [[Scientific theories represent components of the real world]] if they are successful.

When we use formal theories like [[agent-based model]], we are better able to explain things precisely and "tweak the system" compared to verbal theories only.
