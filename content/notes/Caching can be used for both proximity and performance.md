# Caching can be used for both proximity and performance
Date created: 2022-07-18

For example, Amazon warehouses have regional "staging areas" where they are able to send in more copies of items that have been recently popular in an area. They call it "anticipatory package shipping".

This principle can also be useful at home. Put items where you anticipate that they will be used next. Running shoes near the front door.
