# A sustainable way to keep up with the research literature is to read with a goal in mind
Date created: 2022-06-02

Rather than trying to read every journal TOC and any new publication related to your work, you'll be more motivated if you read with a specific goal in mind.

I can really relate to this since the stuff I read for blog posts on the website or my own peer-reviewed publications is what I remember. That's what sticks.

Perhaps as I become more senior academically I will have a hard time dedicating time to reading new things, then this would be a sustainable approach.
