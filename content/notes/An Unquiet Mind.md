# Key takeaways

This book must have been quite radical when it came out in 1995. The author is not only a clinician herself but also a researcher in bipolar disorder, while also suffering from the disorder herself. She speaks honestly about the struggles and how destructive her illness can be without medication.

The section *Flights of the mind*, pages 67-89, was a very strong and disturbing description of her experiences of early manic episodes. It can be used in teaching as an example of bipolar disorder.
