# Task selection is more important than trying to stay on top of everything
Date created: 2022-08-31

Carefully select your tasks and obligations, because if your time is spent on the most valuable and important tasks you will have a large impact even if you don't always manage to stay on top of everything.

> The only viable solution is to make a shift: from a life spent trying not to neglect anything, to one spent proactively and consciously choosing what to neglect, in favour of what matters most.
