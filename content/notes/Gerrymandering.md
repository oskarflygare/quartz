# Gerrymandering
Date created: 2021-09-13

By manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts in the US, you can give one political party an unfair advandage. The negative effects are due to "wasted votes" that do not contribute to electing a candidate. Two main strategies:

- **Cracking**: Diluting the voting power across many districts (makes it easy for the other party to win more districts and all the sub 50% votes cast there are wasted)
- **Packing:** Concentrating the voting power in one district (makes them waste votes there and lose other districts)
