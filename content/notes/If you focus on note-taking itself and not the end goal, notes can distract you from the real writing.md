# If you focus on note-taking itself and not the end goal, notes can distract you from the real writing
Date created: 2021-12-20

He mentioned having project-specific notes instead of just a general vault with highly linked notes. Also referred to the [[Note-taking should be an instrument, not an end in itself]] article.

His adjustments for sustainable note-taking:

- No daily quotes for notes
- Wait to take notes (let the best ideas "survive" the wait)
- Stop taking notes on everything
- Project-based vaults (I use project-based MOCs and folders for this)
