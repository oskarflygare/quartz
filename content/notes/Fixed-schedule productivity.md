# Fixed-schedule productivity
Date created: 2022-05-31

Fixed-schedule productivity for Cal Newport is not just working on a fixed schedule (like 9-5), but he also uses it to allocate a fixed amount of time for certain tasks.

For example, deciding to spending half a day per week on his podcast will sometimes force him to put out one episode instead of two if he needs to do some planning for the podcast that week.

Another effect of the fixed-schedule productivity is that it combats [[Parkinson's Law]] and enables you to be more flexible if your workload shifts. In times of drought you can take on some projects for your own development or reduce the time you work.
