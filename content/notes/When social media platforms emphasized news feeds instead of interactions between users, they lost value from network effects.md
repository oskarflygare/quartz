# When social media platforms emphasized news feeds instead of interactions between users, they lost value from network effects
Date created: 2022-06-17

They found out that they would be making more money just focusing on selling ads to users, but lost their unique position being the platform where "everything" happened. There was an ugly side to this too, with low moderation and lots of divisive news. Seen a lot in [[An Ugly Truth]].

TikTok does the attention-grabbing much better, and is not really focused on network effects. So platforms like Facebook and Twitter will likely be overtaken soon.
