# Success in academia leads to outside demands on your time and focus
Date created: 2022-04-28

Annus Mirabilis, the miracle year when a scientist produces very impactful work. Many brilliant scientists through the ages seem to have this, for example when Newton had to quarantine from University for a year.

This often when they are relatively young and free from "the distractions of success". Once you have produced impactful work, you will be asked to sit on committees and other academic obligations, and you might also get involved in "defending" your thesis from outside criticism. Proper [[Time management]] can help, because youâ€™ll have a better idea ahead of time what your commitments and goals are.
