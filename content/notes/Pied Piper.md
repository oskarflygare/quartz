# Pied Piper of Hamelin
The legend of the Pied Piper originates from Hamelin in Germany. He was a rat cather that played a magic pipe to lure rats away during the plague. However, the citizens refused to pay for his service, so he used the pipe to lure away the town's children.

As a modern [[metaphor]], pied piper is often used to describe a charismatic person who attracts followers or a leader who makes irresponsible promises.
