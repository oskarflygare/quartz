# Information cascade
Date created: 2022-08-04

An information cascade is what is thought to lead to "bubbles" or fads, where individual actors are looking to others for information on how to act.

Public information exceeds private information; you know more *what* people are doing than *why*. This can lead to prices cascading up or down, for example.

[[One way to avoid information cascades is to display doubt publicly]]
