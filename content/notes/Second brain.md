# Second brain
[[Building a Second Brain]] is a book by Thiago Forte, who also uses the [[PARA system]] for organizing your life, a method for  [[Personal Knowledge Management]].

There's a nice [youtube-video](https://youtu.be/OP3dA2GcAh8) that discusses the 10 principles of building a second brain.

Here's a [nice visual guide](https://maggieappleton.com/basb)

# Borrowed Creativity
Creativity doesn't happen in a vacuum, it's about remixing things that already exist. You combine and tweak things in your own way, and that is creative output.

# The capture habit
Off-load your working memory by recording things in a separate system.

# Idea recycling
Ideas are not single-use, instead we use them over and over again in different projects.

# Projects over categories
Don't obsess over categories, instead try to associate the things that you capture to ongoing projects.

# Slow burn vs heavy lifts
Heavy lifting means doing very focused and isolated work during a short time-span. Slow burns are projects that occur over a longer time and on a slow-burner. You gather things over time.

# Start with abundance
We tend to start from a blank page with our creative output. However, by collecting things in something like a second brain, whenever we output something we'll be able to draw from a vast library of things you have gathered over time.

[[Intermediate packets]]
You can break down creative outputs in smaller content blocks, and re-use individual blocks in different contexts.

# You only know what you make
Basically the [[Feynman technique]]

# Make it easier for your future self
Provide enough context and information so that you are able to follow along later when you've forgotten the concept.

# Keep your ideas moving
Don't fall into the trap of perfecting your system FIRST, then creating output. Just get moving and work things out as you go along.
