title: Reading online is F-shaped instead of linear

We find an interesting phrase or heading and read a little bit, then skim forward to the next eye-catching thing, and so on. This creates an F-shape in eye-tracking studies. People rarely read the whole thing, and the pattern persists even if the document is printed.

Adapt your own writing accordingly! I think Morgan Housel mastered this in [[Same as Ever]] where every chapter was packed with quotable one-liners and short paragraphs instead of more traditional book writing style.
