We can apply this analogy to suicide prevention by applying means reduction, e.g. making sure bridges and railroad stations are safer. This is something that Craig Bryan argues for in [[Rethinking Suicide]].

> One, think of risk the way the State of California thinks of earthquakes. It knows a major earthquake will happen. But it has no idea when, where, or of what magnitude. Emergency crews are prepared despite no specific forecast. Buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes that may not occur for a century or more.
