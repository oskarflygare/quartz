# Literature notes
Date created: 2021-08-15

Literature notes are the second step of three in the [[Zettelkasten]] method. It's basically the summary of my understanding from something that I've consumed (like an article, book, video etc.).

If I've read a book in Kindle, I would first export the highlights as a [[Fleeting notes]], and then summarise it in the form of a literature note.
