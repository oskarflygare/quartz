Network analysis of 1343 patients, non-responders had a stronger link between compulsions-distress (item 8, *plåga i samband med tvångshandlingar*) and compulsions-control (item 10, *förmåga att behärska tvångshandlingar*) *p* = 0.002. There was also a stronger link between item 8 and compulsions-interference (item 7, *tvångshandlingarnas hindrande inverkan*) *p* = 0.049.
