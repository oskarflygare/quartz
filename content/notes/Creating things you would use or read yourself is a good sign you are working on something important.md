Rather than trying to impress "everyone" or some vague sphere of influential people, do things that you and your friends respect and value. However, [[Be wary of niche competition that produces things that nobody finds valuable]].

> If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.
