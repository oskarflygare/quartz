# In heads-up poker, there has to be disagreement about sorting for games to happen
Date created: 2022-07-18

Because if both players agree on who's better, then someone is willingly losing to a better player. Says a pro:

> "I have a fairly specific ranking of who I think the twenty or soe best players are, and I think each of them has a similar ranking in their mind. I think there is a pretty high degree of consensus about what the list looks like."

> Only when these rankings differ will cash games ensue.
