# Moment-to-moment mood connections are stronger in individuals with a mental disorder, suggesting that those individuals are susceptible to downward spirals of negative mental states
Date created: 2022-09-12

Individuals with depression, in particular, had strong between-mood connections over time. The high connectivity provides support for the *causality hypothesis*: [[When causal relations among symptoms are strong, the onset of one symptom will lead to the onset of others]].

Support also for the [[Tipping point]] model of depressive mood.
