# Steady state
Date created: 2022-05-19

It’s typically used to describe a system whose properties will be stable over time. The steady state is often achieved after a warm-up period.

In physiology we talk about [[Homeostasis]] which is essentially the same thing but in a biological context. It’s also desirable during medication; we want a dose and an interval between doses that keeps the effects of the medication stable over time.

If there are enough external pressure or stressors, the system might reach a [[Tipping point]] and move to another state, often detectable via [[Critical slowing down]] (recovery to the normal state doesn’t happen as quickly).
