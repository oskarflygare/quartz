# Informal group structures give leaders more freedom and less accountability
Date created: 2022-08-02

By making group structures implicit, you risk having an elite taking control and using poor selection criteria to select new leaders. Rather than valuing competence or contribution, you select for background and personality.

> Thus structurelessness becomes a way of masking power, and within the womenâ€™s movement is usually most strongly advocated by those who are the most powerful (whether they are conscious of their power or not). As long as the structure of the group is informal, the rules of how decisions are made are known only to a few and awareness of power is limited to those who know the rules.
