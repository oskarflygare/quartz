The participants were included from the hospital discharge register, so will filter for more severe attempts compared to other measurement methods.
- 1-year suicide rate for males *without any psychiatric disorder at index* (n = 12 724) = 5.1%
- 1-year suicide rate for females *without any psychiatric disorder at index* (n = 14 280) = 2.8%
