# Peak-end rule
Date created: 2022-08-02

We tend to look at the most intense point and the end of an experience when judging it.

- An experience does not have to be long to have a lasting impact. An intense day in the ski slopes can be just as memorable as a longer trip somewhere with nothing to do.
- Examples:
	- Childbirth (remembering peak emotions and end emotions rather than long swaths of pain in between)
	- Breakups (intense negative emotions at the end masking long periods of positive aspects in the relationship)
