It's very easy to stand on the sideline and criticise, but this should make us more engaged with actually creating things. [[By continuously working on your own projects, you create things and take accountability rather than passively consuming content]].

> On a similar note, author Yuval Noah Harari writes: “To enjoy peace, we need almost everyone to make good choices. By contrast, a poor choice by just one side can lead to war.” ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1707))

> The idea of “complex to make, simple to break” is everywhere. Construction requires skilled engineers; demolition requires only a sledgehammer. Even when something doesn’t break easily, the thing that could break it is usually simpler than whatever made it.
