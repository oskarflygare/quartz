# Hype cycle
Date created: 2022-10-17

It's used in reference to our expectations about new technologies, but can be applied more broadly as a mental model. For example, I often feel the same way relating to new things. First there's a lot of hype and then I realize the drawbacks. After a while, I find ways to use the thing productively.
