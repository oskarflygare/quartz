# Work has been infused with beliefs about self-actualization
Date created: 2022-07-14

The office was never designed to give us transcendence or fulfillment beyond earning an honest wage.

> The economists of the early 20th century did not foresee that work might evolve from a means of material production to a means of identity production. They failed to anticipate that, for the poor and middle class, work would remain a necessity; but for the college-educated elite, it would morph into a kind of religion, promising identity, transcendence, and community. Call it workism.
