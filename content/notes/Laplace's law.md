# Laplace's law
Date created: 2022-07-19

It's a Bayesian method for estimating probability based on observations. Let *w* be the number of outcomes, and *n* be the number of attempts.

$\frac{w+1}{n+2}$

So if you have 4 observations in 10 attempts, you do 5/12 â‰  42%.

[[Laplace's law is useful with few data points]]
