# A new model for decision making needs to focus less on bias, be realistic, be environment specific, and multidisciplinary
Date created: 2022-10-17

The author in [[We don’t have a hundred biases, we have the wrong model]] argues that we need a new comprehensive model rather than just adding to the list of cognitive biases.

Four features:
- A weakened focus on *bias*. The goal of decision-making is to minimize error, and a biased decision-making tool will sometimes have the lowest degree of error.
- The brain has limited resources, and we should consider this rather than requiring optimal decisions every time.
- Decision-making should be viewed in context.
- A new model of behavior will be multidisciplinary. "It won't involve economics picking up a couple of random pieces of psychology. We will find insight across the sciences."
