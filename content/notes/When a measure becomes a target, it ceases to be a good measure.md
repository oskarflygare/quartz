# When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
Date created: 2022-05-19

This is Goodhart’s law, named after British economist Charles Goodhart.

It’s very often in action when we evaluate academics, and resort to [[bean counting]] number of 1st author articles or h-index. But it’s hard to [[Measure what is meaningful, not what is easy]] because the meaningful measures are not readily available. And maybe we shouldn’t have targets for “number of new ideas”, “number of meaningful studies”?

I have resorted to process measures like the number of [[Pomodoro technique]] sessions I get in, because then I can fill it with some more vague activity like “Writing” which obviously has many steps.
