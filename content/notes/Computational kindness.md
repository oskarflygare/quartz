# Computational kindness
Date created: 2022-08-04

It's an approach where you strive to reduce the computational burden on others.

For example "I'm flexible" or "What do you want to do tonight?" places the computational burden on the other one ("you handle it"). And, they have to simulate your preferences, potentially putting them into [[Recursion]] and leading to lots of anxiety.

## How to be computationally kind?
- State your preferences
- Reduce the number of options that you give other people
