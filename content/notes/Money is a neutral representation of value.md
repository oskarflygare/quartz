# Money is a neutral representation of value
Date created: 2021-08-18

If your aim is to provide something valuable to the world, whether and how much people are willing to pay for your service/product/entertainment is a good indicator of value. But [[Don't let money be a detour to achieving other values]], it is a useful indicator in some sense but shouldn't be the *only* thing controlling what you work on.
