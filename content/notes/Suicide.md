[Swedish data, here is the link](http://fohm-app.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/Folkhalsodata/pxweb/sv/A_Folkhalsodata/A_Folkhalsodata__A_Mo8__Halsoutfall__02Pyskhals__02.07Sjlvmord/SjlvmordAld.px/chart/chartViewLine/)

# Insights

## Epidemiology

- [[There are about 700 000 deaths by suicide in the world each year]]
	- [[India and China alone account for 42% of all suicide deaths]]
	- In Sweden there are [approximately 1200 deaths annually](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/livsvillkor-levnadsvanor/psykisk-halsa-och-suicidprevention/att-forebygga-suicid/statistik-om-suicid/), and another 300 where suicide is suspected but the intention has not been verified.
	- [[More than one in 100 deaths globally are the result of suicide]]
	- [[20% of youth have experienced suicidal ideation, and 7% have made a suicide attempt]]
- [[It is unclear if the recent decrease in suicide mortality is due to suicide prevention activities or general improvements in population health]]
- [[Psychological autopsy studies estimate the rate of psychiatric disorders in suicides to be around 90%]], but
	- [[Epidemiological data suggests mental illness is present in half of individuals who die by suicide]]
- [[An association between regional rates of bipolar diagnosis and suicide deaths in young males suggest that improved bipolar care for youth may reduce suicide mortality]]
- [[The 1-year suicide rate after a suicide attempt is 2.8%]], but [[The 1-year suicide rate after a suicide attempt was 4.4% in a large Swedish study]]
	- [[The 5-year suicide rate after a suicide attempt it 5.6%]]
	- [[The 10-year suicide rate after a suicide attempt is 7.4%]]
- [[Patients recently discharged from psychiatric facilities have almost 200 times increased risk of suicide compared to the global rate]]

	- [[Only 28% of those with self-harm at age 16 were free from mental health or substance use problems, and had adequate educational or employment status]]
- [[The interaction of reduced ideation, increased energy, and improved mood may put individuals within a high threshold of high risk of suicide during spring]]

### Health care contacts before suicide
- [[One month before suicide, 44% of individuals have contact with primary care]]
	- [[In the year prior to suicide, 80% of individuals have contact with primary care]]
	- [[A majority of individuals with suicidal thoughts or behaviors do not disclose them to other people]], but
		- [[As many as 70% of individuals with suicidal thoughts or behaviors disclose their issues when the medium is online writing]]

## Etiology

- [[The increased risk of suicide within families of suicide decedents is primarly explained by a shared genetic etiology, but shared environment factors also play a role]]
	- [[The familial risk of suicide may be particularly high for female first-degree relatives of suicide probands]]
	- [[Losing a parent to suicide is a strong risk factor for suicidal behavior in children]]
-  [[Identifying who will attempt suicide and when may not be necessary for effective prevention]]


## Suicidal ideation and planning

-  [[Making a suicide attempt requires overcoming a predisposed tendency to avoid pain, injury and death]]
- The risk increase leading up to a suicide attempt can be very rapid
	- [[A majority of planning steps leading up to a suicide attempt take place within 12 hours prior to the attempt.]]
	- [[Preparation of personal affairs was the single strongest predictor of a suicide attempt in retrospective interviews]]
	- [[Over half of individuals report onset of suicidal ideation or planning on the same day as their suicide attempt]]

## Costs and resource use
- [[The majority of health-care costs in the year after self-harm are due to inpatient psychiatric care]]
- [[The probability of sickness absence, disability pension and psychiatric care is increased in the years following a suicide attempt]]
- [[DBT-A leads to long-term cost savings compared to treatment as usual due to fewer inpatient and emergency visits]] - [[haga2018]]
- [[The mean hospital cost per self-harm episode in Denmark is over 7000 USD]] - [[dyvesether2022]]

## EMA findings
- [[Suicidal ideation tends to be episodic, with quick onset and short duration]]
- [[Suicidal ideation varies dramatically even during short time-spans]]
	- [[Incorporating the dynamic short-term changes in suicidal ideation and intent improved prediciton of post-discharge suicide attempts]] - [[wang2021]]
	- [[Increased autocorrelation in suicidal ideation measures was an early warning sign for one individual in a proof-of-concept study]]
- [[The mean level and variability of suicidal ideation identified subgroups of individuals with a previous suicide attempt]]
	- [[Individuals with multiple suicide attempts have a tendency to 'get stuck' in states of more intense suicide ideation, whereas individuals with no or one attempt stabilize at a state of low risk]] (not EMA but weekly CBT session ratings)
- [[Being alone, at home, and passive leisure correlated with increased suicidal ideation in patients recently discharged from inpatient care after a suicide attempt]]
- [[K-means clustering of weekly suicidal ideation in adolescents identified a high-risk group which experienced more suicidal events compared to a medium and low-risk groups]]
- NSSI: [[Nonsuicidal self injury was often negatively reinforced and used as a method to escape anxeity, anger or sadness]]

# Assessment
- Meta-analysis by Runeson in 2017: [[runeson2017|Instruments for the assessment of suicide risk]]
	- [[Commonly used instruments in suicide risk do not have adequate sensitivity and specificity]]
- But the PHQ-9 looks decent: [[The PHQ-9 item on suicidality is predictive of suicide attempt or death]] - [[simon2013]]
# Treatment
- Fox 2020 review, some pessimistic findings:
	- [[Intervention efficacy for suicidal thoughts and behaviors has not improved over the last 50 years]]
	- [[Most interventions for suicidal thoughts and behaviors are not linked to common suicidality theories]]

## Brief suicide prevention interventions

- [[Brief acute care suicide prevention interventions reduce the probability of subsequent suicide attempts]]
	- Typically done in one face-to-face session with optional telephone follow-up
	- Brief contact interventions (phased-out contact: 1D, 1W, 2W ...)
	- [[Safety planning Intervention]]
		- [[stanley2012]]
	- Care coordination (handover to psychiatric care. scheduling appointment with clinic or mobile team)
	- [[Enhanced screening and safety planning reduced suicide-related events by 30% after visits to emergency departments]]

### Caring Contacts
- Original study - [[motto1976]], with formal analyses in [[motto2001]]
	- Yes they show lower rates of suicide in the CC group, but the effect is *very* small. 3.9% vs 4.6% suicide rates in the first five years.
- Meta-analysis [[skopp2023]]
	- [[Caring Contacts seems to reduce the rate of suicide attempts at one year follow-up]], RR 0.57
	- [[The evidence to support reductions in suicide from Caring Contacts is inconclusive]]
- Inconsistent results in a study on veterans in the US, n = 657 [[comtois2019]]
- Null findings in veterans, n = 1318 [[luxton2020]]
	- They only recruited about 1/4 of the planned sample, and event rate was lower than expected for suicide. Nevertheless the IRR for suicide was 0.42.
- [[The proportion of self-poisoning repetitions in 12 months did not differ between a caring contacts postcard intervention and TAU]], Australian study, n = 772
	- Main study: [[carter2005]]
	- 2-year follow-up: [[carter2007]]
	- 5-year follow-up: [[carter2013]]
- [[The rate of subsequent suicide attempts was reduced in a 12-month postcard intervention in Iran, n = 2300]]. 3% compared to 5% - [[hassanian-moghaddam2011]]
	- Postcards were sent to everyone with an index self-poisoning and not just the ones without other care. However, TAU often meant no additional care in this context.
- [[A postcard intervention in New Zealand reduced re-presentation for psychiatric, but not all-cause, emergency visits]] - [[beautrais2010]]
	- Some weird stopping of recruitment here, way lower sample size than planned.
- [[A simulation study found that caring contacts would lead to improved outcomes and reduce costs compared with usual care after visits to the emergency department]] - [[denchev2018]]


## CBT-SP
- [[stanley2009]] is the first report with lots of details on the structure. However no efficacy results in there.

## ICBT

### History
- [[Computers have been used to provide one-to-one suicide prevention counselling since 1982]]
- [[As early as 1982, an online forum was used for suicide prevention through counselling in direct messages and referral to a local crisis center]]

# Ethics
- A zero-suicide vision is harmful because we have a poor understanding of who will commit suicide, and our prevention efforts risk harming individuals if we tolerate zero suicides [[sjostrand2023]]

# Psychological theories of suicide

## Ideation-to-action
> The development of suicidal ideation and the transition from suicide ideation to attempts are distinct processes with distinct predictors and explanations [[klonsky2021]]

Suicide risk exists on a continuum from relatively low risk (desire for death) to higher risk (concrete plans).

- Beck's hopelesness theory. Hopelessness is fairly stable over time and ultimately leads an individual to believe that suicide is a viable strategy to deal with untenable cicrumstances.
- Joiner's interpersonal theory. Perceptions of burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness are fairly stable over time and ultimately lead an individual to consider suicide as a means of resolving their situation.

### Klonsky & May's Three-step theory

> In brief, the 3ST suggests that: a) suicidal ideation is caused by the combination of unbearable pain (usually psychological) and hopelessness, b) suicidal ideation is strong when one’s pain exceeds or overwhelms one’s connectedness (to valued people, communities, or sources of purpose and meaning), and c) transition from strong suicidal ideation to potentially lethal suicide attempts is facilitated by dispositional, acquired and practical contributors to capability for suicide. Thus, the 3ST is a concise theory that explains suicide in terms of just four variables: pain, hopelessness, connectedness, and suicide capability.

## Multiple pathways, non-linear
- Fluid Vulnerability Theory. Suicidal ideation fluctuates close to a baseline with episodic peaks representing suicidal crises.
