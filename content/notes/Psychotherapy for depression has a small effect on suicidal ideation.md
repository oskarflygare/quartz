# Psychotherapy for depression has a small effect on suicidal ideation
Date created: 2023-05-16

From a meta-analysis of 3 studies: *g* = 0.12 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.44), not statistically significant.

We should not assume that psychological treatment of depression will automatically lead to a reduction of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; they may need targeted treatment.
