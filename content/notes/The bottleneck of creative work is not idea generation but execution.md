# The bottleneck of creative work is not idea generation but execution
Date created: 2023-04-21

People who recommend the use of PKM and Zettlekasten methods often claim one of the main benefits is that it becomes easier to resurface ideas: e.g. [[Notes can incubate in a PKM and be discovered later]], [[The value of a linked database of notes builds up over time]].

But Cal Newport argues that in his experience (talking to a lot of academics and professional writers), idea *generation* is not the bottleneck. They have tons of ideas all the time! Some of them bad, some of them good. But the real bottleneck is instead in the *execution* of those ideas; actually sitting down to work out the specifics and write something out.

His video title is "Why Professional Thinkers Don't Carefully Track Their Ideas"
