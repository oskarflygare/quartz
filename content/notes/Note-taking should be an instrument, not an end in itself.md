# Note-taking should be an instrument, not an end in itself
Date created: 2021-08-24

Inspired by a charismatic professor, he set out to take extensive notes on everything he was reading. However when it came to actually using his [[Zettelkasten]] to write his thesis, he found that it was just a giant mess of notes and didn't help him at all.

It needs to be clear from the beginning why you are taking all these notes otherwise it's just a polished version of [[Collector's fallacy]].
