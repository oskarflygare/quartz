# Why am I the right person to tell this story?
Date created: 2021-10-05

Do I have a unique perspective, a combination of skills or knowledge, that signals to the reader that I am the right person to tell this story?

Magnus Linton talks about this in chapter 4 of [[Text & Stil]], but Cal Newport often talks about it as well when he responds to questions about non-fiction writing. First you need to convince an agent, then a publisher, *then* you start actually writing.
