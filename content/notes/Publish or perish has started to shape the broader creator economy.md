# Publish or perish has started to shape the broader creator economy
Date created: 2022-04-26

It's trendy to be a "creator" nowadays, making your own independent content and being able to sustain yourself financially. But too much of the conversations is focused on churning out stuff on a fixed schedule and amassing followers, regardless of the actual value of what is produced.

It's similar to [[Measure what is meaningful, not what is easy]] in that we should really to create value rather than massive archives of content.

> When I imagine a cultural renaissance that inspires me, I think about working together to address unsolved questions, tugging on threads in conversations that need unraveling, creating enduring artifacts for generations to pore over and iterate upon. The “publish or perish” model that nudges people to rack up more followers is not the pinnacle of creative freedom; it’s indentured spiritual servitude.
