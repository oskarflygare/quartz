# Rumination
Date created: 2021-09-13

It's a type of repetitive negative thinking often seen in depression when a patient is repetitively and passively focusing on negative aspects of their life, associated negative causes and consequences.

When an individual ruminates, they typically fail to take steps to problem solving.

Rumination is positively reinforced ("klapp på axeln") and negatively reinforced (temporary relief from anxiety):

> Rumination has more recently been conceptualized not as a state or trait construct but rather as a “mental habit” that becomes a reflexive response through positive feedback loops that reinforce it as a learned prepotent behavior
