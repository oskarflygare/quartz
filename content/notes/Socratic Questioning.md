# Socratic Questioning
Date created: 2021-11-09

It's a way to establish [[First-principles thinking]].

1. Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?
2. How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?
3. How can I back this up? What are the sources?
4. What might others think? How do I know I am correct?
5. What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?
6. Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?
