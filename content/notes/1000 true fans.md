# 1000 true fans
Date created: 2022-06-21

The idea is that if you have 1000 "True Fans" that will go to your shows, buy merch, spread the word etc. you can make a living by creating content for those followers.

Despite not taking off the way the author intended in the 2010s, the model is seeing a revival now because [[A subscription model is a sustainable way for content creators to earn money]] and tools like Patreon make that possible.

> The same Internet that allows Netflix to help a small number of cinephiles discover an obscure documentary might also allow that filmmaker to be in touch with these same people directly, perhaps converting what Kelly termed “Lesser Fans” into “True Fans,” defined as those “who will purchase anything and everything you produce,” who “will drive 200 miles to see you sing,” and “buy the t-shirt, and the mug, and the hat.”
