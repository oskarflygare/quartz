# Recursion
Date created: 2022-08-04

Recursion is the infinite process that happens when a computer tries to simulate something as complex as itself. It can happen in humans as well.

In poker you'll often find players trying to understand how much the opponent knows (but the opponent is doing the same thing, of course). Ideally you play one level above your opponent: if you play too far above, the opponent wont even get the info you want to radiate! (This was me playing at parties with complete beginners, no use in complex strategies).
