# By continuously working on your own projects, you create things and take accountability rather than passively consuming content
Date created: 2023-07-10

> ==Develop a habit of working on your own projects.== Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.

Being *active* rather than *passive* is a good rule of thumb.
