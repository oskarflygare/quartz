> ==Develop a habit of working on your own projects.== Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.

Being *active* rather than *passive* is a good rule of thumb.

> Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8k7vajyxnprrcv8y6jzwq5v))
