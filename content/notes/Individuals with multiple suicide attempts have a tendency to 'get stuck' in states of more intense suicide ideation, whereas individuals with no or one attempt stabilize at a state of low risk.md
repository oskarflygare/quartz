> All three groups had attractor set points at a low level of suicide ideation (x < 0.35), which suggests that, regardless of suicide attempt history, suicide ideation tended to be drawn toward and stabilize at a relatively low-risk state.

> Multiple attempters also had a second attractor set point at a high level of suicide ideation (x3 = 2.25), however, indicating that suicide ideation tended to be drawn toward and stabilize at a relatively high-risk state as well.

> Consistent with a cusp catastrophe model, in between these two stable states was a repeller set point from which suicide ideation was pushed away (x2 = 1.65), which indicates that suicide ideation tended to be unstable at moderate levels of risk.
