# Making a suicide attempt requires overcoming a predisposed tendency to avoid pain, injury and death
Date created: 2023-05-10

This is why some researchers argue that *suicide capability* is an important concept in order to understand which individuals transition from ideation to attempts.

**Suicide capability:** "In short, because suicide involves the potential for pain, injury and death, and because people are biologically (and arguably evolutionarily) disposed to fear and avoid pain, injury and death, making a suicide attempt requires the capability to overcome these barriers."
- *Practical* suicide capability is knowledge of, access to, and expertise with lethal means
