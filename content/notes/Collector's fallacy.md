# The collector's fallacy
It's the tendency to hoard digital notes (like my Notion library) with links to blogs and other superficial things. Not something that you have actively worked with. It's first mention was Nick Milo youtube channel. It's clear how the [[Evernote]] web clipper encourages you to just grab everything, but it's not processed in any way. Reminds me of the "You only know what you make" principle of [[Second brain]] and the [[Feynman technique]].

For example just reading books without actively engaging with them. The contrast is [[Evergreen Notes]] which are supposed to continue to grow, link, and develop over time.
