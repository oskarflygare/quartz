# Auxiliary hypotheses
Date created: 2021-09-06

It's a "cushion belt" around your core hypotheses. If an experiment fails you can blame the auxiliary hypothesis instead of falsifying your theory.

From an episode of everything Hertz, paper by Anne scheel and Daniel lakens

> Before testing hypotheses, researchers should spend more time forming concepts, developing valid measures, establishing the causal relationships between concepts and the functional form of those relationships, and identifying boundary conditions and auxiliary assumptions.
