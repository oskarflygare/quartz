# Predictive models
Date created: 2022-08-23

The goal of these types of models is to produce accurate predictions for *new data*. Estimation over inference, interest in the value itself rather than evaluating hypothesis related to the data.

"Will I sell more than 100 copies of book X next month?" = [[Inferential models]]

"How many copies of book X will customers purchase next month?" = Predictive model

Sub-categories are [[Mechanistic models]] and [[Empirically driven models]].
