# Discipline can sometimes mean doing less, not just more
Date created: 2022-09-27

I often think that discipline means working out more, focusing more etc. But just as important is knowing when to do less. Sometimes having fewer things on your plate means each thing you actually do gets more attention and [[Putting more time into a specific project can have outsized effects on its quality and value]].

*Persist and Resist*

This is not particularly challenging right now because I am kind of sealed off from outside demands, but [[Success in academia leads to outside demands on your time and focus]] & [[Success can distract you from focusing on the things that produce success in the first place]]. I think *resist* becomes more of an issue then.
