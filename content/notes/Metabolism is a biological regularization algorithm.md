# Metabolism is a biological regularization algorithm
Date created: 2022-07-19

The human brain consumes around a fifth of our calories, which is a testament to its importance. But a *more* complex brain probably suffered from [[Diminishing returns]] so we didn't end up with brains that consumed 50% of our energy.

> The burden of metabolism, for instance, acts as a brake on the complexity of organisms, introducing a caloric penalty for overly elaborate machinery.
