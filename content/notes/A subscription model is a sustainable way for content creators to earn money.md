# A subscription model is a sustainable way for content creators to earn money
Date created: 2022-06-21

If you create content that a subset of consumers are willing to subscribe to (like a $10/month subscription), you will have a more stable income than just relying on ads or virality. Because [[The high pace of information consumption promotes passive consumption rather than active interaction with creators]], you cannot expect to have viral "hits" result in long-term growth.

The example given in the article includes 10s of thousands of subscribers, but it's an example of the [[1000 true fans]] idea. But to generate those true fans you need quality content, hence [[Depth over width is the path forward for content creators]].
