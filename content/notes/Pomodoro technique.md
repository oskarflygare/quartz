# Pomodoro technique
Date created: 2022-05-19

It’s a productivity technique I’ve used for a long time, the basic structure is that you work on something for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break, then 25 min work again. You should not distract yourself while the timer is running.

You can work on one big task for the entire 25 minutes, but can also throw together many small tasks in one block. I might do a pomodoro block just clearing the email inbox och checking off small admin tasks.

Other intervals like 50/10 and 45/15 are used as well, Cal Newport even does 90-min blocks in his [[Time management]] which is a formalized system where pomodoros can be used.
