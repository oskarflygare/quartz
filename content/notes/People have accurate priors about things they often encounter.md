# People have accurate priors about things they often encounter
Date created: 2022-07-19

We absorb information about things through experience, so most people have accurate priors about movie lengths, human lifespans, poem lengths etc.

Since [[Good predictions require good priors]], we are good at estimating things where we have experience but poor at other things (in the example they ask people to estimate pharaohs' reigns in ancient Egypt).
