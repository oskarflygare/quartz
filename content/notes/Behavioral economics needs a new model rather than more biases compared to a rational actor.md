# Behavioral economics needs a new model rather than more biases compared to a rational actor
Date created: 2022-10-17

The list of human biases already contains more than 200 things and *effects*, but we lack a unifying theoretical framework

> From a predictive point of view, you have a range of countervailing biases that you need to disentangle. From a diagnostic point of view, you have an explanation no matter what decision they make. And if you can explain everything, you explain nothing.
