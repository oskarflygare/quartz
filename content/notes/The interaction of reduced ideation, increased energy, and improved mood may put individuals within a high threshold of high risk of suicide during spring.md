The idea is that someone might be severely depressed from the winter months, and that the energy increases faster than mood during spring. They also "carry over" negative cognitions from winter.

The authors argue that this is in line with the increased risk after psychiatric discharge: [[Patients recently discharged from psychiatric facilities have almost 200 times increased risk of suicide compared to the global rate]] because then you might also have improved energy faster than improved mood.
