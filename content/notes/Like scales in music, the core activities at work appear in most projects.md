# Like scales in music, the core activities at work appear in most projects
Date created: 2022-07-04

Scales are never the "end product" of a musical piece, but they are helpful to practice because they appear in one shape or another in most songs.

Common chord progression are the same thing. The II-V-I progression will never be the *only* thing that happens in a song but if you recognize the pattern it will help you learn and then navigate a song.

If you flip the perspective and look at fundamental, core, problems: [[Working on the right question means aiming at the core of a problem]].
