AUC went from 0.71 (baseline data) to 0.89 when adding these dynamics to the model.

Time-series features for each item included magnitude/speed/probability of change over time: min, max, mean, sd, percentage unique values, mean square successive difference, probability of acute change, maximum change.

The most important predictor, by far, was **the probability of an acute change in the desire to die by suicide**: "How intense is your desire to kill yourself right now?". Probability of acute change in the two other items were number 2 and 3 in importance.
