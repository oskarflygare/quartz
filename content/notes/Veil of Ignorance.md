# Veil of Ignorance
Date created: 2021-12-14

Itâ€™s a technique to test ideas for fairness. The originator is the philospher John Rawls who used it to think about how a just society would function. The veil of ignorance asks that you describe a just society behind a *veil of ignorance* so that you do not know where in the society you will end up.
