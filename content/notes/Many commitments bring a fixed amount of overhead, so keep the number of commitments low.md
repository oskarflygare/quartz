# Many commitments bring a fixed amount of overhead, so keep the number of commitments low
Date created: 2022-05-31

If you increase the number of active commitments/projects, you’ll quickly start spending a majority of your time on those overhead tasks (meetings, admin, planning).

However if you keep the number of current commitments relatively low you’ll free up a larger proportion of your time to actually make progress on those things. This is important to keep in mind for me as [[Success in academia leads to outside demands on your time and focus]].
