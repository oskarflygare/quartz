A lot of creatives pre-computer used these as a combination of study notebook/personal journal/sketchpad for new ideas.

Tools like Obsidian can be thought of as digital versions of the commonplace book. When it works the best, it is a private space to work out ideas and problems before we share them with others.

> Popularized in a previous period of information overload, the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the commonplace book was more than a diary or journal of personal reflections. It was a learning tool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their place in it.

Sounds like some central figures in Stoicism used idea notebooks as well, from *The Daily Stoic* newsletter:

> keeping kinds of notebooks on important subjects (what the Greeks called hupomnemata), which must be reread from time to time so as to re-actualize their contents.

Erasmus loved using his commonplace book as a kind of proto-PKM in the 1570s:

> The Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus, in his 1572 textbook De Copia, stressed the connection between memory and reading. He urged students to annotate their books, using "an appropri ate little sign" to mark "occurrences of striking words, archaic or novel diction, brilliant flashes of style, adages, examples, and pithy remarks worth memorizing." He also suggested that every student and teacher keep a notebook, organized by subject, "so that whenever he lights on anything worth noting down, he may write it in the appropriate section." Transcribing the excerpts in longhand, and rehearsing them regularly, would help ensure that they remained fixed in the mind. The passages were to be viewed as "kinds of flow-ers," which, plucked from the pages of books, could be preserved in the pages of memory.

It's interesting that the strategy in all cases seems to have been to keep notebooks separated by subject, and recording things that resonate in them. Very much like having MOCs for various things and adding your notes and thoughts over time.
