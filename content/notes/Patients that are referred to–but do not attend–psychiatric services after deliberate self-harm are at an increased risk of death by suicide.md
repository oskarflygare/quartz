# Patients that are referred to–but do not attend–psychiatric services after deliberate self-harm are at an increased risk of death by suicide
Date created: 2023-03-27

The referral means that the clinician saw a need for psychiatric follow-up, and lack of attendance for these individuals is particularly bad. Around 20% of the sample that received a referral did not attent, so this might be a very high risk group.
