Mental models are useful tools for thinking because they let us identify the structure of a system quickly, they are shortcuts for thinking strategically. I have some categories below which are rough and should not limit the use of a mental model beyond that category; it's simply the origin or a common context.

# Categories

[[Theory of constraints]]
[[Parkinson's Law]]

## Physics
Critical Mass

## Chemistry
[[Steady state]]

## Economics
[[Compound growth]]
[[Marginal gains in many aspects can have a big impact]]
[[Discounting]]
[[Opportunity cost]]
[[Diminishing returns]]

# Putting mental models to use

## When optimizing systems

When using mental models we want to optimize *systems*, some examples:
- **A process** (economic growth, maintaining a romantic relationship)
- **A business** (sports team, company)
- **A machine** (toothbrush, rocket)
- **A state of being** (health, happiness)

### 1. One level Higher
Are you optimizing at the right level?

### 2. Theory of Constraints
Which of the system's inputs holds the constraint to further progress? Where is the bottleneck?

### 3. First principles
If you don't get to where you want to be using the theory of constraints, re-examine the system from the ground up. Work from the foundations to create something better.

## When making decisions

### Long-term: Regret Minimization
*Long-term fulfillment*

### Medium-term: Pareto Principle
*Years, decades*
Who to spend time with, which skills to hone, which career decisions to make

### Short-term: ICE
*Weeks and months*

- **Impact** if successful
- **Confidence** that I will succeed
- How **easy** is this goal to pursue

 ### Immediate: Eisenhower Matrix
 Useful for making day-to-day decisions
