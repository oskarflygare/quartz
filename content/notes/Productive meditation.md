# Productive meditation
Date created: 2021-08-18

It's a term coined by Cal Newport in his book [[Deep work]], where you think of a problem you are currently working on while doing something that does not occupy your mind. It can be during a walk, swim, run, hike, etc.

This often helps to produce new insights and unexpected solutions if you've gotten stuck.

Can also be referred to as putting a problem on the back burner or a slow burn as Thiago Forte puts it.
