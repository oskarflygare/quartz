# Appeal to nature
Date created: 2022-09-26

It's the tendency to think that *natural* things are better.  Very common rhetoric when it comes to food and skincare products (only organic materials, natural ingredients).

It's also a common argument for alternative medicine treatments, to not use medicines and instead some "natural" cure.
