# Overton window
Date created: 2021-12-13

The *Overton Window* describes the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time.

If you want to shift the Overton window, one strategy is to use the [[Door in the face]] strategy and promote an extreme idea to try to "drag" the Overton window closer to your desired idea.
