# What is easy to understand is not necessarily what is true

Sometimes the best ideas require nuance and depth. Somewhat of a counterargument to [[Occam's razor]] and good to keep in mind.

For example firefighting in the early 1900s. In the US they decided to be very aggressive and put out every small fire to avoid larger ones. But some trees needed forest fires to grow, and when they put out every small fire the flammable materials accumulated to create more dangerous fires later. So now the strategy is fire *management* instead, keeping them reasonable.

This is like the butterflies in that Radiolab episode, who needed some chaos to thrive: https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/bombs-and-butterflies

> Some summaries illuminate. Most obscure. Better to think a little longer, if you want to take the thread seriously.
