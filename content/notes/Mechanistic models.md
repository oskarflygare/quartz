# Mechanistic models
Date created: 2022-08-23

If you have a set of assumptions or estimates, you create a model that predict the unknown parameters.

For example, predicting the amount of a medication in a person's body at a given time.

The feedback loop is much faster than for hypothesis test, because you measure the accuracy continuously.
