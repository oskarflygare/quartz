# When scheduling your tasks, multiply the required time by importance
Date created: 2022-07-18

This is a good rule of thumb for task prioritization, work on the tasks with the highest density.

You can also assign a task an *hourly rate* just as consultants do.

Animals do the same when looking for food, they spend more time looking for food with high caloric density.

> Staying focused not just on getting things done but on getting *weighty* things done–doing the most important work you can at every moment–sounds like a surefire cure for procrastination.
