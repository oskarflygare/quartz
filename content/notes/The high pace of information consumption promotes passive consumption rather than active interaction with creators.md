# The high pace of information consumption promotes passive consumption rather than active interaction with creators
Date created: 2022-06-21

Most apps have a feed of content that you scroll through, and the feed is optimized for engagement. In such a context you are less likely to click on individual content pieces and interact with the creator, and much more likely to just keep scrolling to the next viral piece.
