# Murmuration
Date created: 2023-01-16

Birds in a flock see only their nearest neighbors and move in line with them, but the entire flock seems to be moving in a synchronized pattern even without central leadership.

> In a murmuration, each bird sees, on average, the seven birds nearest it and adjusts its own behavior in response. If its nearest neighbors move left, the bird usually moves left. If they move right, the bird usually moves right. The bird does not know the flockâ€™s ultimate destination and can make no radical change to the whole.

The structure of the network shapes behavior in that network, but behavior within the network can also change the structure.
