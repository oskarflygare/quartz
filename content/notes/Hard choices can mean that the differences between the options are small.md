# Hard choices can mean that the differences between the options are small
Date created: 2022-08-02

So instead of spending *more* time deliberating between two similar options, we should just pick something and go with it. The difference is likely small anyways.

> When making decisions, we spend too much time choosing between options with roughly equal utility.

> Some people spend way too long at restaurants deciding what to order. Pick a couple of items that sound good and then ask the server which is better.
