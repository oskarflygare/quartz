# Disease names can imply causes
Date created: 2022-05-17

Two doctors saw the same symptoms in a patient, one called i *suppuration of blood* because he thought the cause was a formation of pus in the blood. The other called it *leukemia*, which in German loosely translates to white blood (because there's an abundance of white blood cells).

The golden rule is to try to use names that don't imply causes because we might be blind to other explanations and stuck in [[Confirmation bias]]. But there is likely low [[Historical contingency]], especially in psychiatry!
