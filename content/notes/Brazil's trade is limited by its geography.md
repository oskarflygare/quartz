Most big cities, like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, are squeezed in between the ocean and "the shield", a high rise in mountains just next to the coastline. [[Export in Brazil is made difficult by few navigable rivers connected to the coast]].

All the land from there to New Orleans can benefit from navigable rivers to ship what they produce. São Paulo can’t do the same even if it’s a stone’s throw away from the ocean!
