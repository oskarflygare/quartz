# Attention residue
Date created: 2022-06-02

It's what happens when you have multiple things in your mind at the same time, and cannot fully focus on the main thing. It typically takes about *23 minutes* to refocus after distraction.

The hypothesis is: Not being able to give something your complete focus will reduce your ability for critical thinking, analysis, writing, reading comprehension etc.
