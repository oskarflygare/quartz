# Insertion sort
Date created: 2021-11-11

If you are sorting a bookshelf, insertion sort is when you pull out all the books, then take one book at a time and put back. However, on average you still need to move past half the books before you find the correct place. This technique also yields quadratic time in [[Big O notation]]
