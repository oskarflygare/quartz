# Text-generating AI will highlight all the bullshit things we do when we work on computers
Date created: 2023-03-10

So focus instead on the writing and work that *actually matters*. Not the words you choose for an email but thinking about ideas, testing your own knowledge on a subject, arguing a moral view.

> The briefings, meetings, memos, proposals, timesheets and invoices, the deliverables, code and code reviews, the marketing campaigns, and analyticsâ€¦ Work on the screen has all been a simulation of work before AI started simulating the simulation. Time to leave the simulation of simulations to the machines. Let *them* print money while *you* focus on things that matter. Okay. But what matters, now?
