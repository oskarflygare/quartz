## Why and when I was reading this
I've just started using Obsidian and am interested in Personal Knowledge Management to retain and re-use information more easily.

### Key takeaways
* Projects => Every current projects (see def. below) that are actionable with their notes, files, artifacts
* Areas => Zone of responsibility with standard to uphold over long periods, parent, animals, management, coding, house
* Resources => Zone of interest for various topics that donâ€™t require standard/responsibility, game, phone, productivity, self development, technology
* Archive => Where things from all the other category become unused, finished, change of responsibility etc
