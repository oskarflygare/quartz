# Quantifiable outcomes enables one-off comparisons rather than many pairwise sorts
Date created: 2022-07-18

For example, you don't have to have many marathons with each runner up ahead, you simply measure their time. Compare to boxing.

But sometimes in my field we resort to [[bean counting]] which may not capture all of the important aspects to consider.
