# Having a tendency to respond irrationally can discourage others from harming you
Date created: 2022-08-04

Even though it might not be rational to respond with a lot of revenge (you risk harming yourself), cultivating that *image* will discourage others from bothering you.

If you are stuck in the [[prisoner's dilemma]] as a member of organized crime, you know that ratting on the other guy will probably mean you are killed. So this changes the equillibrium of the situation. So this means that the gang leader rarely has to hand out that punishment, it's just the image.

This will be super relevant for [[Tills Alla DÃ¶r]] reflections!
