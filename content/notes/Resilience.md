Resilience can be studied within psychology, but it's also a common topic in ecology and other disciplines. Sometimes within the framework of complex systems theory. I've started to read articles within this area in order to explore avenues for [[Cross-pollination]]. Some related ideas come up in [[Network theory of psychopathology]], such as [[Tipping point]] and [[early warning sign]].
