# As the economic structure of newspapers shifted, so did their reporting
Date created: 2022-04-22

When newspapers went from ads to subscriptions, their incentives shifted too. From  trying to reach the most broad set of readers possible, to catering to the people that are already subscribing.

So rather than strengthening their neutral reporting to offer something else than their online counterparts, they were incentivized to become more partisan. It's an example of the [[Overton window]] shifting for the newspapers.
