# Lindy Effect
Date created: 2023-01-02

Something that has been around for a long time is likely to be resilient and continue surviving. 

> The **Lindy effect** (also known as **Lindy's Law**) is a theorized phenomenon by which the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things, like a technology or an idea, is proportional to their current age. Thus, the Lindy effect proposes the longer a period something has survived to exist or be used in the present, the longer its remaining life expectancy. Longevity implies a resistance to change, obsolescence or competition and greater odds of continued existence into the future.
