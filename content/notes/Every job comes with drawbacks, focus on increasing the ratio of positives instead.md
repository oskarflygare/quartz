Realize that there will never be a job without "bullshit", and if you can have it so half of your time is enjoyable that's a big win.

The same is true at the level of projects, there's always overhead and bullshit: [[Many commitments bring a fixed amount of overhead, so keep the number of commitments low]]

> If you recognize that inefficiency—“bullshit,” as Pressfield puts it—is ubiquitous, then the question is not “How can I avoid all of it?” but “What is the optimal amount to put up with so I can still function in a messy and imperfect world?” ([Location 2095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2095))

> Volatility. People having bad days. Office politics. Difficult personalities. Bureaucracy. All of them are bad. But all have to be endured to some degree if you want to get anything done. ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2109))

> Jeff Bezos once talked about the realities of loving your job: If you can get your work life to where you enjoy half of it, that is amazing. Very few people ever achieve that. Because the truth is, everything comes with overhead. That’s reality. Everything comes with pieces that you don’t like.
