# Inertia
Date created: 2022-05-19

> Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to a change in its velocity

It’s a concept from physics, but it can be applied to other areas as well. For example, Julian Shapiro talks about it in terms of goals and values in [[How to figure out what to do with your life]].

Developing solid [[Habits]] can be a way to combat inertia and procrastination, because then you’ll have some things ingrained and won’t have to plan out every little thing you want to do.
