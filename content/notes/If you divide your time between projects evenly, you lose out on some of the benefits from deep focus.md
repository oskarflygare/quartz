# If you divide your time between projects evenly, you lose out on some of the benefits from deep focus
Date created: 2023-07-10

This rings similar to comments from Cal Newport: [[Many commitments bring a fixed amount of overhead, so keep the number of commitments low]] and [[Putting more time into a specific project can have outsized effects on its quality and value]]

> Don't divide your attention *evenly* between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law. Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4r2tkw457ged7a1y6kpgn86))
