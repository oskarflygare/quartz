# As a notes database grows, search becomes more difficult
Date created: 2022-07-18

This points to a paradox that a lot of people experience as they take notes: the more notes they gather, the more the volume of information grows, the more time and effort it takes to review it all, and the less time they have to do so.

This is similar to how [[Human memory can be seen as a cache]] because remembering becomes harder with more memories (natural as we grow older).
