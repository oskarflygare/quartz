# Feynman technique
Richard Feynman was a great teacher and many attribute this to his use of a specific learning technique. He would strive to convey information using concise thoughts and simple language. He would identify a subject, explain it briefly in plain terms, identify his knowledge gaps, and use storytelling techniques to improve the way he explained the topic.
