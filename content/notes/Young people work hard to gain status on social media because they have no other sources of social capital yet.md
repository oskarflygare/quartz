# Young people work hard to gain status on social media because they have no other sources of social capital yet
Date created: 2023-03-10

Adults may laugh at them, but they have accumulated social capital already and don't have to work as hard to gain more.

> Secondly, because of their previously accumulated social capital, adults tend to have more efficient means of accumulating even more status than playing around online. Maintenance of existing social capital stores is often a more efficient use of time than fighting to earn more on a new social network given the ease of just earning interest on your sizeable status reserves.
