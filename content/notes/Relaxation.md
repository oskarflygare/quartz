# Relaxation
Date created: 2022-07-21

It's a strategy often used in computer science, where you make a problem easier by, for example, removing constraints. Then you try to solve the easier problem before moving onto the more difficult one.

> If you can't solve the problem in front of you, solve an easier version of itâ€“and then see if that solution offers you a starting point, or a beacon, in the full-blown problem. Maybe it does.

## Chapter notes
- [[A minimum spanning tree is a useful benchmark for route problems]]
	- [[Traveling salesman problem]]
	- [[Constraint Relaxation]]
	- [[Continuous Relaxation]]
	- [[Lagrangian Relaxation]]
