# Shibboleth
Date created: 2023-01-02

Shibboleth is a phrase or word that is used as a sort of password for a group. It can be used in wartime, for example US soldiers during World War II used to shout "lollapalooza" to see if the enemy responded with an accent or not.

Ideas can be a Shibboleth too:

> An absurd ideological belief is a form of tribal signaling. It signifies that one considers their ideology more important than truth, reason, or sanity. To one's allies, this is an oath of unwavering loyalty. To one's enemies, it is a threat display.
