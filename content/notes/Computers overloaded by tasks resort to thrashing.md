# Computers overloaded by tasks resort to thrashing
Date created: 2022-07-18

[[Thrashing]] occurs when a computer is overloaded, and it's completely preoccupied with metawork.

> When merely remembering everything we need to be doing occupies our full attention – or prioritizing every task consumes all the time we have to do them – or our train of thought is continually interrupted before thoughts can translate to action – it feels like panic, like paralysis by way of hyperactivity. It's thrashing, and computers know it well.
