# Lower demand for psychological treatments, due to non-medical interpretations of symptoms and structural issues in underserved areas, should not be ignored
Date created: 2022-08-29

It's too simplistic to think that, if we increased access to psychological treatments, the issue could be resolved. There may also be lower demand in some areas because affected individuals attribute their suffering to structural issues like poverty and other stressors.

> ...people fail to seek mental health services–and disengage from services–because people interpret their psychological and emotional states as reactions to social and economic problems, not as health conditions that can be addressed by medical services.
