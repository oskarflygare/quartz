Great review article: [[Robinaugh2020 - The network approach to psychopathology, a review of the literature 2008-2018 and an agenda for future research]]

Overview of the Dutch project *New Science of Mental Disorders*: [[Roefs2022 - A new science of mental disorders, Using personalised, transdiagnostic, dynamical systems to understand, model, diagnose and treat psychopathology]]

## What network theory is

> Mental disorders as systems of interacting components, rather than mere passive reflections of an underlying common cause (McNally, 2020)

The current dominating model relies on the [[Germ theory of disease]]. Also referred to as "common cause" model, [[Borsboom2018 - Brain disorders Not really Why network structures]] and "latent variable" model.

[[McNally2016 - Can network analysis transform psychopathology]] : Instead of focusing on "hallmark symptoms", we should put weight on symptoms that are non-specific and appear in many disorders since they may be particularly important (centrality hypothesis and comorbidity hypothesis). Recommends more frequent measurement through apps (rating mood several times per day).

[[van den Hout2014 - Psychiatric Symptoms as Pathogens]] : If we say that symptoms are *caused by* diagnosis it becomes a tautology and circle reasoning. Underlying biological mechanisms or even markers have yet to be seen.

[[McNally2020, What is Mental Illness#Network approach to psychopathology]]

Systems-based approaches may be the best way to cumulatively build and improve theoretical models of mental disorders [@borsboom2022] - [[Borsboom2022 - Systems-based approaches to mental disorders are the only game in town]]

## Terms and analysis

[[Network nodes]]

[[Network edges]]

[[Axiom of local independence]]

[[Tipping point]]

[[Bistable system]] : A system in which there are two equillibrium states. Depressed vs non-depressed. Both states are relatively stable once established.

Example of critical slowing down and tipping points in MDD - [[Lempuut2014 - Critical slowing down as early warning for the onset and termination of depression]]

[[Symptom networks can have contagion effects where activation spreads through the network]] - connectivity hypothesis

[[When causal relations among symptoms are strong, the onset of one symptom will lead to the onset of others]] - causality hypothesis

[[Symptoms occuring in multiple disorders can bridge activation between the networks]] - comorbidity hypothesis

[[Central symptoms have greater potential to spread activation throughout the network]] - centrality hypothesis

## Methods

[[pairwise Markov random field|PMRF]]

Bootstrapping and [[Regularization]] in network analysis -  [[Epskamp2018 - Estimating psychological networks and their accuracy, A tutorial paper]]

[[Network predictability|Node predictability]]

### Different types of networks

[[Association networks]] : only strength of association, undirected

[[Partial correlation networks]] : adjusting for the influence of all other nodes

[[Relative importance networks]] : adding direction

[[Bayesian networks]]

[[Tipping point]] and [[Critical slowing down]] as early indicators of rapid change in systems [[Scheffer2012 - Anticipating Critical Transitions]]

## Network structure analyses

[[Olatunji2019 - What is at the core of OCD, A network analysis of selected obsessive-compulsive symptoms and beliefs]] : Negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts were the most central symptoms, but their predictive power on OCD symptom severity was weak.

[[Meier2020 - Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in eating disorders, a network investigation]] : ED and OCD clusters distinct from one another. Interference due to obsessions most central OCD symptom.

[[Forrest2022 - Change in Eating-Disorder Psychopathology Network Structure in Patients With Binge-Eating Disorder, Findings From Treatment Trial With 12-Month Follow-Up]] : Strength centrality estimates pre-trt, post-trt and 12-month follow-up

[[McNally2017 - Co-morbid obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression, a Bayesian network approach]] : Distress from obsessions as a bridge symptom -> sadness -> rest of MDD cluster

[[Hellberg2022 - Co-occurring depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, A dimensional network approach]]: Obsessions and negative affect were central to symptom networks in patients with co-occurring OCD and depression

[[Litvin2022 - A Network examination of Symptoms of Obsessive-compulsive disorder and sleep disturbances]]: In patients with primary OCD and no MDD, there were weak associations between symptoms of insomnia and OCD.

[[Cervin2020 - The Centrality of Doubting and Checking in the Network Structure of Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Dimensions in Youth]] : Doubting/checking most central symptom

[[Ong2021 - Obsessive-compulsive Symptoms and Other Symptoms of the At-risk Mental State for Psychosis, A Network Perspective]] : Depression most central symptom, anxiety important bridge between OC and other symptoms (general psychopathology questionnaire)

[[Kuckertz2022 - Does the network structure of obsessive-compulsive symptoms at treatment admission identify patients at risk for non-response]] : Baseline network differences (Y-BOCS items) between responders and non-responders.

[[Berlim2021 - The network structure of core depressive symptom-domains in major depressive disorder following antidepressant treatment, a randomized clinical trial]] : Networks more connected at post-treatment, most central symptoms were fatigue (pre) and depressed mood (post).

[[Blanken2019 - Introducing Network Intervention Analysis to Investigate Sequential, Symptom-Specific Treatment Effects, A Demonstration in Co-Occurring Insomnia and Depression]] : Weekly assessments of symptom networks. First effects on sleep issues, later effects on sleep satisfaction. Effects on depressive symptoms likely indirect via sleep improvements.

[[Blanken2021 - Symptom-specific effects of cognitive therapy and behavior therapy for insomnia, A network intervention analysis]] : Specific CT and BT effects, but not 100% overlap with the 2022 study below. No process measures.

[[Lancee2022 - Network Intervention Analyses of cognitive therapy and behavior therapy for insomnia, Symptom specific effects and process measures]] : Specific effects of CT and BT at mid- and post-treatment, in line with theory of respective trt.

[[Cervin2020 - Symptom-specific effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy, sertraline, and their combination in a large randomized controlled trial of pediatric anxiety disorders]] : One study investigated the network effects of CBT and sertraline in treating pediatric anxiety, and found that the treatments were effective through reductions in the same symptoms [@cervin2020b]

[[Bernstein2021 - Mechanisms of cognitive-behavioral therapy effects on symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder, a network intervention analysis]] : similar to Blanken, repeated analyses. CBT more effective in targeting BDD thoughts and behavior change, SPT more effective in improving insight. Changes align with therapy modules in CBT

[[Moment-to-moment mood connections are stronger in individuals with a mental disorder, suggesting that those individuals are susceptible to downward spirals of negative mental states]]

## Remaining questions

Recent developments include methods for aggregating results in meta-analyses, confirmatory network analysis and longitudinal network analysis [@epskamp2022] - [[Epskamp2022 - New trends in network modeling of psychopathology]]

### Formal theories

![[Robinaugh2020 - The network approach to psychopathology, a review of the literature 2008-2018 and an agenda for future research#Next steps]]

[[McNally2021 - Network Analysis of Psychopathology, Controversies and Challenges]] : Varying coefficients between studies does not mean that network analyses per se are non-replicable.

From [[Roefs2022 - A new science of mental disorders, Using personalised, transdiagnostic, dynamical systems to understand, model, diagnose and treat psychopathology]]:

### Clinical utility

- Can we use central nodes as treatment targets?
	- "Positive cascade" or low hanging fruit
- Do more central symptoms predict OCD severity and other clinical outcomes better than non-central symptoms?
	- We might also see that *common factors* are more important than the CBT specific targets
- Experimental manipulation of central symptoms -> wide effects on other parts of the network? Here we have multiple useful examples from the experimental literature, reviewed in [[van den Hout2014 - Psychiatric Symptoms as Pathogens]]. High responsibility -> Compulsions, and Perseveration of compulsions -> Uncertainty
- More frequent data collection, similar to mood ratings in depression, interesting to explore?
- Confirmatory network analyses, meta-analyses, not just exploratory results
- Can network structures help predict onset of mental illness (See Boschloo 2016)

### How is therapy effective from a network point of view?
- Lowering or removing one central symptom
- Remove an external stressor (too much to do at work, bullying in school)
- Change the relationship between two symptoms
