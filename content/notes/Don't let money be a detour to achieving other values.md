Don't let money be a detour to achieving your other values. You can spend money to get fame, power, adventure, etc. But why take a long detour to get money and then the other values instead of chasing them directly?

This is why money should be a lower priority than most people assume, because of [[Hedonistic adaptation]] and [[Diminishing returns]] after a certain income level. Regardless of my next career move I'll likely be close to or beyond that income level.
