# To be a good conversation partner, you should offer up lots of grips that the other person can grab on to
Date created: 2023-03-10

So you should throw in digressions, confessions and bold claims. I like the bold claim strategy just to stir things up and get the discussion going. It doesn't have to be things that I really believe in!

> When done well, both giving and taking create what psychologists call _[affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance)_: features of the environment that allow you to do something. Physical affordances are things like stairs and handles and benches. Conversational affordances are things like digressions and confessions and bold claims that beg for a rejoinder.
