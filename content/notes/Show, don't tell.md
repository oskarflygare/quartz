# Show, don't tell
Date created: 2021-10-05

Magnus Linton calls it the *mantra of writing advice*. You want to show the reader why something is important, not say that it is.

Early in a text, think about what you can add to show that it is relevant to read more. Often an unexpected event, unknown fact, or similar.
