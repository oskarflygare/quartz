title: If we view the internet as a garden instead of a stream, we build and develop instead of argue and present

Blogging and social media are clear streams, whereas Wikipedia is more like a garden. The individual pages of Wikipedia expand and develop over time, and you are supposed to return multiple times to the same place. Compare this to a Twitter feed.

> In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.

> The “conversational web”. A web obsessed with arguing points. A web seen as a tool for self-expression rather than a tool for thought. A web where you weld information and data into your arguments so that it can never be repurposed against you. The web not as a reconfigurable model of understanding but of sealed shut presentations.
