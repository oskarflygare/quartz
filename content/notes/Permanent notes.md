# Permanent notes
Date created: 2021-08-15

It's the final and permanent form of notes in the [[Zettelkasten]] system. Niklas Luhmann used index cards so the space is very limited. Another word often used is [[Evergreen Notes]] for example by Andy Matuschak.

**Some principles:**
* One single idea per note
* Small and many over large and few notes
* Should be easy to understand in isolation (e.g., ten years from now when I don't have the context)
