# A-B testing is a strategy for explore exploit
Date created: 2021-10-20

[[A-B testing]] can be used as a strategy for [[Explore Exploit]] problems. You'll want to balance your outcomes by showing some visitors new versions of your site so that you have a chance to discover a new *best* version. However, at the same time you also want to show the *current best* version to maximise gains in the short term.
