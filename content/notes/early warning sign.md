> An early-warning signal is a within-system change in dynamics (indicative of critical fluctuations and/or critical slowing down) that is predictive of a phase transition.

The system has rising instability which precedes a [[Tipping point]].
- Stable state -> rising instability (increased variability) -> re-stabilization in a new attractor state

## Early warning signs can only be studied within-person

We can't do between-individual things but need within-individual measurements. Typically intensive time-series data. The system dynamics can vary between individuals.

## Early warning signs should precede phase transitions

Can phase transitions be defined and predicted for the individual?

## There should be periods of relative stability
In the figure above:
- Before transition: EWS increase
- After transition: EWS decrease

How long are the time periods? We have lots of timescales in psychology, from *developmental time* (onset of psychopathology) to *real-time* (panic attack) with something like [[sudden gains]] is somewhere in between.
