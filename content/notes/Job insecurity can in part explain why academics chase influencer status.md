# Job insecurity can in part explain why academics chase influencer status
Date created: 2022-06-14

Especially junior academics, who rarely have permanent positions. You want to constantly "sell" yourself and prove yourself worthy of an academic career.

But we should not blame the individuals since metrics like these are often encouraged or imposed from above.
