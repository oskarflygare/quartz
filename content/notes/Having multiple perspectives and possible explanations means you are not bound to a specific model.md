# Having multiple perspectives and possible explanations means you are not bound to a specific model
Date created: 2023-01-16

It's better to cultivate multiple [[Mental models]] rather than putting all your eggs in one basket.

> Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible. Consider all of them plausible until you find some evidence that causes you to rule one out. That way you will be emotionally able to see the evidence that rules out an assumption with which you might have confused your own identity.
