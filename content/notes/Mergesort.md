# Mergesort
Date created: 2021-11-11

You start with two items and sort them, then merge with another stack of two sorted items, then merge with one with 4, etc. You break the quadratic time conundrum seen in [[Bubble sort]] and [[Insertion sort]].

The algorithm lands between linear and quadratic time, *linearithmic* time in [[Big O notation]].

But one drawback is that [[Early rounds in single elimination tournaments can have big consequences]].
