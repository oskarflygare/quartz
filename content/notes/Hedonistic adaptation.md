# Hedonistic adaptation
Date created: 2022-05-19

I think about it as the “rubber band” that pulls you back to your baseline mood after big life events, positive or negative.

I remember a study on lottery winner and victims of car crashes, which found that after a certain time (1 year? 5 years?) their life satisfaction was back to the starting point.

Some take-aways from this effect: [[Don't let money be a detour to achieving other values]] because you will likely bounce back to your [[Steady state]] anyways.

And: all things will pass, even the terrible events.
