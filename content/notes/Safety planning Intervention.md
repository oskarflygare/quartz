# Safety planning Intervention
Date created: 2023-03-08

It's a common brief psychological intervention for suicidal patients in the emergency department, delivered in 25 to 40 minutes. Typical components are:
- Identifying personalized warning signs for an impending suicidal crisis
- Determining internal coping strategies that distract from suicidal thoughts and urges
- Identifying family, friends, and social places that distract from suicidal thoughts and urges
- Identifying individuals who can help provide support during a suicidal crisis (can be the same as above, but preferably just one or two persons that know about the safety plan)
- Listing mental health professionals and urgent care contacts
- Lethal means counseling (removing dangerous objects)
