The "Desire paths" often occur in parks and urban planning when the route of pavement is not the optimal one in daily use.

This concept can also relate to work: Even if a system is designed a certain way, how is it actually used in daily practice? Often not the way the designer intended! This is a good feedback signal: don't force work onto the designed path but adapt to the desire path.
