## Chapter notes
- In asynchronous communication, you can't distinguish a slow response from someone ending the conversation. (Very relatable in online dating...)
	- Typical response times can set the expectations (seconds on the phone, days on email, weeks over postal mail)
- [[Exponential backoff]]
	- [[Exponential backoff between connection attempts is patient while not wasting time]]
- [[A drawback of digital communication is that the messages never go away]]
