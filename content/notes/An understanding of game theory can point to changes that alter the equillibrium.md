# An understanding of game theory can point to changes that alter the equillibrium
Date created: 2022-08-04

One example in the book is vacations. Americans take out little vacation, as noted in [[Workism Is Making Americans Miserable]], so one CEO offered cash to employess for taking vacations. But the problem was that the equillibrium: everyone wanted to impress their boss by taking slightly less vacation than their peers.

With understanding of game theory, the alternative is to make some length of vacation mandatory. If you can't change the race, you can change the direction.
