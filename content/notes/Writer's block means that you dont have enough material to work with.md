# Writer's block means that you dont have enough material to work with
Date created: 2022-07-06

If we believe in the power of a PKM, [[Writing]] should happen once you have gathered enough notes on a topic to create a tentative outline and start to fill in the gaps.

Nothing to write about? It might be that you lack the (note) material to get started.

> “writer’s block”: “It’s not that I’m blocked. It’s that I don’t have enough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always means, not that I can’t find the right words, but rather that I don’t have the ammunition.” ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=478))

> It just means you don’t yet have enough raw material to work with. ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=482))
