Johnny Decimal is a file-sorting system that ensures that all your files have a certain structure. It's popular among the [[Personal Knowledge Management|PKM]] crowd.

The hierarchy is as follows:

10 Areas (XX.)
10 Categories within areas (.YY)
Files within each category then contains two numbers for the area, and two numbers for the category.

For example, if 30-39 is personal, and 36 is travel, then a file with a diary from a specific trip would be named: 36.01 "Italy trip 2015".

## Why is this useful to me?
I work across many different file-storage systems and this could help me sync them up properly.
