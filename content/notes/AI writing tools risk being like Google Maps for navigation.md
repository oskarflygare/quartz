When we simply don't need the skill in our day-to-day lives, it will erode. However, if we accept that [[Writing is the medium of research]], it also runs the risk of degrading our ability to *think*. Writing is hard, but the best way to develop your own thinking about a subject.

The average person would not need to be able to string words into sentences and paragraphs on his own, only to read and alter the text that a machine spits out. Habib likened it to how the rise of navigation apps has eroded people’s ability to get around on their own.
