# Knowledge work contains building blocks that can be used in multiple projects
Date created: 2022-07-06

My own R code is a great example, since I often go back to old projects and grab some code for a new one. Right now I have a manageable amount but it's probably a good idea to create some sort of index file where I list techniques used in various papers.

How to apply this to writing? Having [[atomic note]] with [[Propositional titles help linking atomic notes together]] could be one idea, I've also tried the "example citation" section.

Thiago Forte talks about [[Intermediate packets]] in his book [[Building a Second Brain]].

> eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity. ([Location 1910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09LVVN9L3&location=1910))
