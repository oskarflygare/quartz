Apply [[Occam's razor]] when writing:

> given two written passages which convey almost the same meaning, the shorter passage is usually better

Clear and vivid explanations are preferable, and shortening usually accomplishes this. [[Concise explanations accelerate progress]] and [[Concise explanations spread faster because they are easier to read and understand.]]
