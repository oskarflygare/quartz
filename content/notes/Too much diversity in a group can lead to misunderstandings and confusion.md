# Too much diversity in a group can lead to misunderstandings and confusion
Date created: 2022-08-02

You have different expectations about behavior, and judge each other's behavior according to different criteria. This will lead to confusion and time spent sorting conflicts rather than working towards the group's goal.

> too great a diversity among members of a task-oriented group means only that they continually misunderstand each other. Such diverse people interpret words and actions differently. They have different expectations about each otherâ€™s behavior and judge the results according to different criteria.

> Usually, they only lead to confusion and endless hours spent straightening out conflicts no one ever thought would arise.
