# Writing is the medium of research
Date created: 2021-09-06
All the common academic activities are done through writing: peer-reviewed manuscripts, grant proposals, lectures, seminars.

Writing is also what makes it possible to gain new insights and connect ideas to each other. Notes help with this, but should not be the end goal: [[Note-taking should be an instrument, not an end in itself]]
