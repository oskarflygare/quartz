# Symptom pool
Date created: 2021-10-12

It's the pool of accepted descriptions of disease in a given context. It may shift over time and differ between cultures. Similar to the [[Overton window]] in politics, which describes the range of acceptable views.

When you look at culturally-influenced disorders like electric allergy or ME they will include disease descriptions that are accepted in the context.
