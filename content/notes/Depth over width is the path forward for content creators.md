When any type of artistic output became "content", somethign was lost on the way. Instead of quality output, people are measured on the rate of production and what serves the algorithm [[Measure what is meaningful, not what is easy]].

What's the way forward? Depth over width. Use [[Deep work]] strategies and focus on:
- 1-on-1 interactions
- cultivating a community (1000 true fans)
- make something big
