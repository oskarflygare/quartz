# The value to explore or exploit shifts across the lifespan
Date created: 2021-11-05


Toddlers are extreme "explorers" and it makes sense that they explore relentlessly. On the other hand, as we grow older it is more valuable to exploit the things that are most valuable.

For example, the social networks of elderly people become smaller, but we can understand that as a rational choice to "exploit" the most meaningful relationships while [[Pruning]] less valuable ones.

Late in life, you can "savor the fruits of lifelong exploration".
