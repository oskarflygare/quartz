## Research output

### Mindset and approach

- [[When your main goal as an academic is to learn about and solve the most important problems, publications and other activities are byproducts]]
	- [[Unsolved problems and questions can be viewed as sources of curiosity]]
- [[Successful individuals often reverse-engineer recipes for success and ignore external factors]]
- [[10 habits for a successful postdoc]]
- [[Characteristics of successful researchers and founders]]
- [[Success can distract you from focusing on the things that produce success in the first place]]
- [[Principles of Effective Research]]
- [[If research output functioned like open source projects, it would be easier to correct, improve upon and build on your findings]]
- [[A sustainable way to keep up with the research literature is to read with a goal in mind]]
- [[Subtle or slow progress in research feels frustrating and unrewarding]]
	- [[Slow progress in research feels worse when it is broken down into discrete tasks]]

### Project selection

- [[Work on solvable, not grand, problems]]

![[Productivity#Work on the right things]]

![[Productivity#Less is more]]

## Collaboration

- [[Positivity, contribution, and aligned ambitions are traits of great scientific collaborators]]
- [[Success in academia leads to outside demands on your time and focus]]

## Teaching

- [[If you think about students as future colleagues, your teaching will emphasize active engagement]]
