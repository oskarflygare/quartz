# Slow productivity enables seasonality in work
Date created: 2022-06-03

For example, professors have clear seasonality during the academic year with semesters and two months in the summer that are always free from teaching. From what I’ve seen at KI the teachers have intense work during their courses, then a bit of recovery before the next one and 1-2 courses per semester.

With a [[Slow productivity]] mindset you’ll look at the bigger picture and see that full focus on your teaching during that specific period is better than trying to juggle all responsibilities at the same time.

- [[Steady state]] of work is when you neither have intense teaching/fieldwork nor sabattical
- Intense period is when you have a high teaching load
- Recovery is when you can recharge for the steady state, after an intense period
