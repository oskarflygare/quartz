# Core question

How can we increase access to psychological treatments for mental disorders while at the same time maintaining quality and efficacy?

---

# ICBT



# App-based treatments

## Advantages
- Can collect other types of data
	- Monitoring mood more closely
	- Location (timely reminders when you get home or get to work)
	- Activity (e.g., sleep schedule and lack of physical activity)
- Easy access throughout the day, no need to log onto a website


## Current issues

[[Lower demand for psychological treatments, due to non-medical interpretations of symptoms and structural issues in underserved areas, should not be ignored]] - [@roberts2022]

[[Despite often claiming to be evidence-based, few apps designed to treat common mental disorders have direct evidence to support their efficacy]] - [@larsen2019]

[[The effect sizes associated with app-based treatments are generally smaller than face-to-face or ICBT]] - [@linardon2019]

[[Mental health apps often share data with third parties without properly disclosing it]] - [@huckvale2019]

# Stratified care

The argument here is that we have (semi)automated treatment selection so that patients go into therapy quicker. For example selecting between low- and high-intensity treatments rather than putting everyone through stepped care
