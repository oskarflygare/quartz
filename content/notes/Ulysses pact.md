# Ulysses pact
Date created: 2022-08-04

It's a decision that is designed to bind yourself in the future.

It's a motivational trick where you restrict your options before a situation arises (like Ulysses tying himself to the ship's mast before reaching the siren's call) or create severe punishments for not sticking to the plan (donating $5000 to the KKK if you smoke a cigarette).
