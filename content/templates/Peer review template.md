-   Try to put the findings of the paper into the context of the existing literature and current knowledge
-   Indicate the significance of the work and if it is novel or mainly confirmatory
-   Indicate the work's strengths, its quality and completeness
-   State any major flaws or weaknesses and note any special considerations. For example, if previously held theories are being overlooked

  
## Major issues

-   Are there any major flaws? State what they are and what the severity of their impact is on the paper
-   Has similar work already been published without the authors acknowledging this?
-   Are the authors presenting findings that challenge current thinking? Is the evidence they present strong enough to prove their case? Have they cited all the relevant work that would contradict their thinking and addressed it appropriately?
-   If major revisions are required, try to indicate clearly what they are
-   Are there any major presentational problems? Are figures & tables, language and manuscript structure all clear enough for you to accurately assess the work?
-   Are there any ethical issues? If you are unsure it may be better to disclose these in the confidential comments section
