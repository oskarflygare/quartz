A reviewer of one of my first publications said: "...ultimately, I don't think these types of studies make a meaningful contribution to the scientific literature." Maybe they were right.

During my PhD studies, I focused most of my attention on developing my skills in [[Core activities]] and learning the tools of the craft. While this was useful, it also affected my approach to research questions and potential projects. Selecting what to work on became a task of matching the project to one of the tools in my toolbox, or deciding to add a new tool. What was missing from that approach was *why*: why should I be working on this specific project and not something else? Since [[Doing important work starts with working on important problems]] and [[Task selection is more important than trying to stay on top of everything]], it is worthwhile to reflect on which projects should be a priority and which not.

# Developing taste

[[Actively developing your taste in your field of work will help you select projects]]. This involves reading a lot, and sometimes outside your own field. Reading the most influential papers in your field gives you plenty of examples of (hopefully) good writing and clear thinking, while reading outside your own niche opens up the ability to reason by analogy and [[Cross-pollination]].

While reading, ask yourself why a certain piece of research became influential. What made this publication good in the eyes of peers? Perhaps they discovered something with far reaching consequences, [[Working on the right question means aiming at the core of a problem]]. Perhaps they addressed an old problem using a novel approach, in that case ask yourself where that approach came from.

As an example from my own field, imagine the impact of establishing Hoarding Disorder as a separate condition, rather than a part of OCD. Research building up to change has far-reaching consequences when it comes to epidemiology, treatment, etiology and so on.

# Using problems as a source of inspiration

In our day to day lives we avoid problems whenever we can. If we encounter one, we look for solutions or fixes immediately. Even though researchers are more patient when it comes to problems, we still use [[Unsolved problems and questions can be viewed as sources of curiosity]].
