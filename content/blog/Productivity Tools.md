# Productivity Tools

## Todoist - task manager
It's helpful to use some Todoist labels (tags in other systems) such as:
- *waiting* (for things sent away where I am waiting for feedback, or I need input from somewhere to continue)
- *develop* (for tasks that do not yet have a proper due-date or where more thinking is needed)
- *writing* (tasks suitable for writing time-blocks)
- *analysis* (tasks suitable for analysis time-blocks)

One guy has a quite extensive list, but I think mine should grow organically:

```context
#c/errand #c/work #c/home #c/personal

focus #f/easy #f/med #f/hard #f/deep

when #w/now #w/next #w/soon #w/later #w/someday

status #s/ready #s/wip #s/waiting #s/done #s/processed

type #t/index 

to #to/read #to/review #to/process #to/plan #to/clarify #to/write #to/do #to/improve #to/decide #to/call #to/slack #to/email #to/migrate

```

## Google Calendar

Self explanatory!

## Github - version control for statistical analyses

Whenever I do statistics, create a Github repo and store scripts under version control. Analysis-related tasks can be tracked in Github project boards.

## Obsidian - notes

Obsidian sits on top of the OneDrive folder and is the editor I use to create and link notes. Maybe also a good idea to separate notes from the document you are writing in. So don't import a crazy amount of notes etc.

- Reading research articles
- Meeting notes
- Notes and drafts related to current projects
- Idea generation and creative output

## OneDrive - file storage

Self-explanatory

- Personal files: Use [[Johnny Decimal]] system
- Shared files: Follow whatever order exists

## Toggl - time-tracking

It's interesting to see how much time I manage to spend doing deep work and how much time is allocated to different projects. This is tracked using Toggl and I can get reports on various time scales.

## R and RStudio

- RStudio can be used for manuscript writing as well, and I can merge R objects with text
