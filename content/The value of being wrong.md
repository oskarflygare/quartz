Admitting to being wrong is rarely, if ever, rewarded in the public sphere. It can also be painful on a personal level, and changing some beliefs should indeed require a lot of evidence. I still believe, though, that on the whole we should embrace being wrong more often.

Being disproven is a sign of *good*, not bad, thinking. If you strive to be ruthless towards your beliefs and opinions about the world, you will get into the habit of expressing your ideas in a specific enough way for them to be disproven or corrected. This will sharpen your ideas over time, improving what's of high quality and discarding what turns out to be less useful.

Scientists are expected to produce specific and falsifiable hypotheses, and design studies that can readily disprove them. But too often we cling to our beliefs despite evidence against them, rather than updating our worldview and moving on to greener pastures.

From a [lecture by Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman](https://www.edge.org/adversarial-collaboration-daniel-kahneman):

> However, it turns out that I only changed my mind about the evidence. My view of how the mind works didn't change at all. The evidence is gone, but the beliefs are still standing. Indeed, I cannot think of a single important opinion that I have changed as a result of losing my faith in the studies of behavioral priming, although they seemed quite important to me at the time.

From [The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/10/23/16-learnings/):

> **1. Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind.** Cultivate that capacity for [“negative capability.”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/11/01/john-keats-on-negative-capability/) We live in a culture where one of the greatest social disgraces is not having an opinion, so we often form our “opinions” based on superficial impressions or the borrowed ideas of others, without investing the time and thought that cultivating true conviction necessitates. We then go around asserting these donned opinions and clinging to them as anchors to our own reality. It’s enormously disorienting to simply say, “I don’t know.” But it’s infinitely more rewarding to understand than to be right — even if that means changing your mind about a topic, an ideology, or, above all, yourself.
