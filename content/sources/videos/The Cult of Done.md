# Key takeaways
* Everything is a draft, it will never be perfect! Even when done/published et cetera
* There is no editing stage. If you make a mistake, you start again or keep going. Don't tweak what you've got, make another one!
* _If you wait for more than a week, leave it_
	* This is why things like NaNoWriMo work
* The point is not to be _done_, the point is to keep going with other things
- Failure is good, it shows you tried! You learn something for the next time
- *Ideas are worthless, give them away*

> No piece of writing is ever finished... It's just due.
