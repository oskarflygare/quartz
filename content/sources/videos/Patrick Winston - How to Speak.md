Knowledge > Practice > Talent 

> Your success in life will be determined by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas. In that order.

# How to start

In the beginning of a talk, people are still settling in and getting used to your voice.

Start with a promise: What will the audience learn that they didn't know? Why will they stay and listen to your talk.

# Four sample heuristics

- Repeat your points and cycle back to the main topic.
- Build a fence around *your idea* so that it can be distinguished from what others have said and done. Explain how it differs.
- Verbal punctuation
- Questions (but balance difficulty)

# The tools

## Time & place

**Time:** When is the audience alert? Not straight after a meal, not too early.
**Place:** Is the lighting adequate? Prefer lighter rooms to dark ones, inspect beforehand, it should have the right size for your audience (more than 50% filled).

## Props, boards, slides

One advantage of writing by hand on a board is that it can be used graphically, the speed is appropriate to the way you talk, and it can be used as a target of focus.

You can use props to illustrate a point, like the pendulum that swings across the room and then stops right before the teacher's face.

Both writing on a board and using props are more tactical and tangible than using slides, because the audience will *feel* what you are doing.

### Rules for slides

> There are always too many slides and too many words

- Do not read from them
- Be in the image
- Keep images simple
- Eliminate clutter

Your audience can either read from the slide, or listen to the speaker. When there is a lot of information on the slides, that is prioritized over what the speaker says.

# Tools to promote learning

- Symbol
- Slogan
- Surprise
- Salient idea (something that sticks out)
- Story

# Use cases

## Informing

- Provide a promise (about learning something)
- Exhibit passion about what you are doing!
- Storytelling
	- Which stories they need to know
	- Questions to ask
	- Ways of analyzing stories

## Persuading

Within the first five minutes, establish these three.
- Situate the problem: who cares about this, why is an answer to this question important
- Show that you have a vision
	- People care about the problem
	- You have a new approach
- Show that you have done something
	- Illustrate the steps that need to be taken to solve the problem

End by illustrating your contributions to the problem.

# How to stop

## Final slide

Name it *Contributions* and list your accomplishments.

## Final words

> I always finish with a joke, because then people think they have had fun the whole time!

You don't *have* to say "thank you", you can also salute the audience by acknowledging them being here.
