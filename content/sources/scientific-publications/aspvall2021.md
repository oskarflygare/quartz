# Abstract
Therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective treatment option for children and adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder, but to our knowledge, its cost-effectiveness compared with traditional in-person treatment has not been established.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy implemented within a stepped-care model compared with in-person cognitive behavioral therapy for young people with obsessive-compulsive disorder.This economic evaluation of a randomized noninferiority trial conducted at 2 specialist obsessive-compulsive disorder clinics in Sweden enrolled 152 children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with obsessive-compulsive disorder, mainly through clinician referrals (110 [72%]). Recruitment began October 6, 2017, and ended May 24, 2019. Follow-up ended April 14, 2020.Participants were randomly assigned to receive either guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or in-person cognitive behavioral therapy during a 16-week period. At the 3-month follow-up, nonresponders in both groups were offered additional in-person cognitive behavior therapy sessions.Health outcomes were treatment response rates (primary outcome), remission rates, and quality-adjusted life-years. Cost data were collected before treatment, after treatment, at 3-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up (primary end point) and are presented in 2020 US dollars. The differences in incremental costs and health outcomes were compared between the groups and presented from the health care professional, health care sector, and societal perspectives.A total of 152 participants (94 girls [62%]; mean [SD] age, 13.4 [2.5] years) were randomized; 151 (99%) completed the trial. At the 6-month follow-up, 50 of 74 participants (68%) in the stepped-care group and 52 of 77 participants (68%) in the in-person cognitive behavioral therapy group were classified as treatment responders (odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.51-1.98]; P = .99). Health economic analyses showed that the stepped-care group used fewer therapist resources than the in-person cognitive behavioral therapy group, resulting in a mean cost savings of $2104 (95% CI, $1202-$3006) per participant for the full study period of 10 months, corresponding to a relative savings of 39%. The cost savings remained largely comparable when taking wider health care sector and societal perspectives.This study suggests that, for young people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, a low-cost digital intervention followed by in-person treatment for nonresponders was cost-effective compared with in-person cognitive behavior therapy alone.
