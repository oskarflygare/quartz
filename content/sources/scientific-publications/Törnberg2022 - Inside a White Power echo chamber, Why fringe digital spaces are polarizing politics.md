# Example citation

[[Echo chambers drive community formation through the use of a shared language and particularly many custom in-group words]]

# Key takeaways
- Discourse-analysis: "this article draws on Randall Collins and the Durkheimian tradition to develop a theory of discursive community formation."
* 20 years of posts on Stormfront, analyzed using natural language processing.
	* ~10 million posts
	* ~350k users
	* Filtered by those who had sent >50 posts
* It took roughly 10 posts for new users to converge on the community language
	* Those who left the forum before 50 posts tended to be (language-wise) further away from the community at the start. So pushing out those who do not conform to the community.
* Echo chambers drive community formation through the use of a shared language and particularly many custom in-group words
