# My notes
- The OG p-factor paper is [[Caspi2014 - The p Factor -One General Psychopathology Factor in the Structure of Psychiatric Disorders]]

- They used SEM for modeling the p-factor (`lavaan` in R)
- *Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)* was used to establish *p*
- Aggressive behavior and rule-breaking behavior had strong positive correlations beyond *p*
- Withdrawn/depressed was negatively associated with attention problems and aggressive behavior after accounting for shared *p* variance.
- Lots of strong correlations between *p* and clinical outcomes in the direction you would expect.
- They suggest that youth high in *p* may need treatment for broader outcomes instead of disorder-specific CBT. Another suggestion is to include core processes (emotion dysregulation, emotional impulsivity) in CBT

> ...higher *p* at baseline was associated with lower functioning/more impairment at all follow-up assessments.

> Importantly, p was the only predictor consistently associated with outcomes across time and measures, also when controlling for baseline diagnostic comorbidity, indicating that p is related not only to a narrow set of outcomes but to broad outcomes, and that it is not simply a proxy for diagnostic comorbidity.

# Abstract
Objective
Pediatric anxiety disorders can have a chronic course and are considered gateway disorders to adult psychopathology, but no consistent predictors of long-term outcome have been identified. A single latent symptom dimension that reflects features shared by all mental health disorders, the p factor, is thought to reflect mechanisms that cut across mental disorders. Whether p predicts outcome in youth with psychiatric disorders has not been examined. We tested whether the p factor predicted long-term psychiatric and functional outcomes in a large, naturalistically followed-up cohort of anxiety-disordered youth.
Method
Children and adolescents enrolled in a randomized controlled treatment trial of pediatric anxiety were followed-up on average 6 years posttreatment and then annually for 4 years. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate p at baseline. Both p and previously established predictors were modeled as predictors of long-term outcome.
Results
Higher levels of p at baseline were related to more mental health disorders, poorer functioning, and greater impairment across all measures at all follow-up time points. p Predicted outcome above and beyond previously identified predictors, including diagnostic comorbidity at baseline. Post hoc analyses showed that p predicted long-term anxiety outcome, but not acute treatment outcome, suggesting that p may be uniquely associated with long-term outcome.
Conclusion
Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders who present with a liability toward broad mental health problems may be at a higher risk for poor long-term outcome across mental health and functional domains. Efforts to assess and to address this broad liability may enhance long-term outcome.
