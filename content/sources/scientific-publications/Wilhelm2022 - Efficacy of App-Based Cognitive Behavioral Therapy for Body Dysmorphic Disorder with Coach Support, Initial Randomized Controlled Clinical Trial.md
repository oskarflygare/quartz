# Example citation

In a randomized controlled trial, app-based CBT for BDD outperformed waitlist control with a large effect size (*d* = 1.44) [@wilhelm2022]

# Key takeaways
* Perspectives app developed by Koa Health
* Typical CBT techniques like cognitive restructuring and ERP
* n = 80, waitlist control
	* 31 in app-CBT completed post-treatment
	* 37 in waitlist completed post-treatment
* Between-group effect size at post, *d* = 1.44 
* 68% responders, 52% remission (observed data only)

Their pilot study: Wilhelm, S., Weingarden, H., Greenberg, J. L., McCoy, T. H., Ladis, I., Summers, B. J., Matic, A., & Harrison, O. (2019).

They updated power calculation after expecting a 10% loss in power due to COVID(!)

> Pre-COVID-19, the study was powered a priori to detect a BDD-YBOCS group difference of effect size d = 0.90 by week 12, assuming two-sided α = 0.05, 90% power, equal group allocation, 15% dropout, and a sample size of 64. We increased the sample size to 80 on 12/11/2020 to reflect a 10% decrease in the anticipated effect size from 0.90 to 0.81 due to COVID-19 stressors. Fifty-six participants (70%; n = 28 per group) were subsequently enrolled (after 3/16/2020).
