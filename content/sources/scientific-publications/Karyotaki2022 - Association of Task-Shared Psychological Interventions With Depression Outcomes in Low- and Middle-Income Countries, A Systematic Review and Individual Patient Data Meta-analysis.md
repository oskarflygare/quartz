## Results

> Of 13 eligible trials, 11 (4145 participants) contributed IPD. Task-shared psychological interventions were associated with a greater decrease in depressive symptom severity than control conditions (Hedges g, 0.32; 95% CI, –0.26 to –0.38). Participants in the intervention groups had a higher chance of responding (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.80) and remitting (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.99). The presence of psychomotor symptoms was significantly associated with the outcomes of task-shared psychological interventions (β [SE], –1.21 [0.39]; P = .002). No other significant associations were identified. Heterogeneity among the trials with IPD was 74% (95% CI, 53%-86%).

## Conclusions

> In this meta-analysis of IPD, task-shared psychological interventions were associated with a larger reduction in depressive symptom severity and a greater chance of response and remission than control conditions. These findings show potential for the use of task-sharing of psychological interventions across different groups of patients with depression. Further research would help identify which people are most likely to benefit and strengthen larger-scale implementation of this strategy to address the burden of depression in LMICs.
