# Key takeaways
* *k* = 34, *n* = 1804
* Patients had lower activity than controls, SMD = -0.78 (95% CI -0.99 to -0.57)
* I thought there would be more on critical slowing down and tipping points, but this was just an overall MDD vs healthy control summary.

> We conducted a meta-analysis of studies examining psychomotor retardation measured by actigraphy in depression. This is the largest meta-analysis examining this association to date, the first to investigate multiple moderators that could potentially contribute to psychomotor retardation. The results indicated patients with (a) current unipolar, (b) current bipolar depression in depressed state, (c) remitted unipolar depression, and (d) bipolar depression in euthymic state all exhibited significantly lower levels of activity compared to healthy controls. None of the moderators had an effect on the results.
