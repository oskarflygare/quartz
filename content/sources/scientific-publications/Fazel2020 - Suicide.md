# Key takeaways
* What explanations have been put forward for regional differences?
	* How suicide is classified
	* Attitudes
	* Access to lethal means
	* Adequacy of treatment for mental disorders
* Means restriction strategies play an important role: restrictive alcohol policies, detoxification of domestic gas, restrictions of firearms.
* [[There are approximately 20 suicide attempts for every death by suicide]]
* [[Mental illness is present in half of individuals who die by suicide]] (ref 24).
* Five key points:
	* 1. A person who presents with suicidal thoughts may be at risk for suicide even if there are few overt symptoms of a psychiatric disorder
	* 2. Suicide risk should be assessed by considering predisposing and precipitating factors, including recent life events
	* 3. The risk of suicide should be managed through regular follow-up and brief psychological therapy
	* 4. The suicidal person, family members, and those who provide care should all take part in ensuring a safe environment, with removal of the means of suicide such as guns
	* 5. If the risk of suicide is considered to be high or uncertain, the person should be referred immediately to mental health services, and the use of risk-assessment tools should be considered to aid risk stratification and communication among services
