# Example citation

Patients who benefit from EX/RP can safely discontinue SSRI with non-inferior outcomes compared to patients who continue their SSRI [@foa2022].

# Key takeaways
* n = 137 OCD patients. Everyone got EX/RP and those who scored Y-BOCS ≤14 (n = 103) were randomized to either continue SRI or taper to placebo.
* Taper group had noninferior results compared with patients in continuation group (Y-BOCS diff = -0.04 [95% CI inf to 2.28])
