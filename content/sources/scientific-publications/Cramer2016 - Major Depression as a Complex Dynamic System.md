# Key takeaways
* Strong connections with symptoms -> vulnerability to develop MDD
	* A strongly connected network is more likely to end up in a depressed state when pushed by external stressors
* MDD is thought to be a [[Bistable system]] where there are two *attractor* states: depressed and non-depressed
* Domino analogy: close together or far apart
