# My notes
- They argue for the ideation-to-action framework
- Suicidal ideation is only weakly correlated with suicide attempts, and we do not know which individuals will ideation will transition to suicidal behavior.
- "Studies seeking to identify predictors of suicide attempts must in some way control for suicidal ideation; one option is to conduct analyses that test what predicts suicide attempts among those with ideation."

> any intervention for suicide risk should be clear about which aspects are meant to reduce suicidal ideation and which are meant to stop transition from ideation to attempts.

**Suicide capability:** "In short, because suicide involves the potential for pain, injury and death, and because people are biologically (and arguably evolutionarily) disposed to fear and avoid pain, injury and death, making a suicide attempt requires the capability to overcome these barriers."
- *Practical* suicide capability is knowledge of, access to, and expertise with lethal means
