# Example citation

Indicators of socioeconomic stress, for example one more parents outside the labour market or living with only one parent, are associated with a higher risk of OCD [@yilmaz2022].

# Key takeaways
* Danish population registry, n = 7550 with OCD
* Birth order and higher maternal age were risk factors for OCD in males, being an only child was a risk factor for OCD in both sexes.
* Parental education, occupation and income were associated with OCD risk, particularly in females

> Data on early-life family composition (birth order, number of siblings, number of parents in household at proband age 6), parental SES at age 6 (parental income, occupation, and education level), history of parental psychiatric illness, and parental age at birth on OCD risk (i.e., an ICD-10 diagnosis of F42.x) were obtained from Danish population registers.

> Specifically, at least one parent having high in come was associated with lower OCD risk in the combined sample and females. Low-income level for both parents was associated with increased OCD risk in females in the sex-stratified analysis, and this trend was also present in the association between having both parents outside labor market at age 6 and a higher likelihood of OCD diagnosis. The only significant differential effect for sex was observedfor having at least one parent with long-term higher education (i.e., a bachelor’s degree or higher), which was associated with significantly decreased OCD risk in the combined sample as well as in females.
