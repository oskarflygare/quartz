# Example citation

Comorbidity rates of OCD and eating disorders are higher than what would be expected by chance, and this pattern could be due to shared personality characteristics such as impulsivity and perfectionism [@altman2009].

# Key takeaways
* Epidemiological studies on clinical populations suggests the comorbidity is higher by chance
* Impulsivity and perfectionism could be shared constructs
