## Example citation
The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) measures functional impairment in five domains: work, home management, social leisure activities, private leisure activities, and close relationships [@mundt2002]. Each domain is scored from 0 "no impairment" to 8 "very severe impairment". Internal consistency ranges from Cronbach's $\alpha$ 0.70 to 0.94 for the separate items, and the two-week test-retest reliability is *r* = 0.73 [@mundt2002].
