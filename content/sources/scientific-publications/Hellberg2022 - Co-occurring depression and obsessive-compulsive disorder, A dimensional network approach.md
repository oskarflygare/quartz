# Example citation

Obsessions and negative affect were central to symptom networks in patients with co-occurring OCD and depression [@hellberg2022]

# Key takeaways
* Rogers Behavioral Health data, n = 463
* They used factor analysis to decide which nodes should be included in the network, rather than item-level networks
* Insomnia low centrality in the shared network, relevant for [[Forskningsplan VR post-doc]] intro! Important to look at symptom-level relations in specific contexts because the emphasis we put on them may vary.
