# Key takeaways
* Australia's telephone helpline (Lifeline), n = 155 callers
* Four groups:
	* ICBT plus weekly telephone
	* ICBT only
	* Telephone only
	* TAU
* Reductions in suicidal ideation in all four groups, no significant group differences
* But this was a secondary outcome and not really specifically designed for SI
