# Example citation


# Key takeaways
* Many fields of psychology are not cumulative, and theories fade away over time due to lack of interest rather than failure to be corroborated. "One tombstone at a time"
* In more developed sciences, theories are either widely accepted and integrated in the larger body of knowledge or are disproven and abandoned.
* Meehl then identifies 20 difficulties that psychology has to deal with if it wants to become more of a developed scientific discipline with cumulative knowledge acquisition.
	* [[Response-class problem]]
	* [[Divergent causality]]
	* [[Signal versus noise]] ratio is way off: we have a lot of unknown things and pure luck that affects what we study

> ...in soft psychology theories rise and decline, come and go, more as a function of baffled boredom than anything else; and the enterprise shows a disturbing absence of that *cumulative* character that is so impressive in disciplines like astronomy, molecular biology, and genetics (page 807)

> ...it is usually not possible in the soft areas of social science to provide rigorous, explicit, or–the holy word when I was in graduate school–operational definitions for theoretical concepts. (page 815)
