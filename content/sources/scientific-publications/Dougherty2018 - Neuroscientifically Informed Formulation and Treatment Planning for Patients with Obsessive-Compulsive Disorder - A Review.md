## Why and when I was reading this

Within negative-valence systems, both acute threat (fear) and potential threat (anxiety) are implicated in [[OCD]]. Numerous studies have demonstrated abnormal activation of fear circuitry during exposure to aversive stimuli in patients with OCD.7 Regarding anxiety, patients with OCD have elevated anxiety sensitivity and over- estimation of threat compared with healthy individuals.8 Other negative-valence abnormalities seen in OCD include attentional bias9 and [[intolerance of uncertainty]].10 Another important group of constructs and subconstructs that is likely involved in the pathophysiology of OCD is the positive-valence system, specifically, reward learning and responsiveness to reward. Individuals with OCD are hypervigilant to reward feedback and opt for immediate relief (reduction of anxiety) at the cost of longer-term benefit (quality of life).11 In other words, patients with OCD seem unable to modulate their future behavior based on immediate feedback. Related to this, [[Habits]] formation appears to be abnormal in patients with OCD. In a neurocomputational study by Valerie Voon et al,12 the inves- tigators found that patients with OCD made choices based on model-free (ie, habit) vs model-based (ie, executive control) learn- ing. Finally, deficits within the cognitive systems, namely cognitive control13 and response selection, inhibition, or suppression,14 have been demonstrated in patients with OCD.
