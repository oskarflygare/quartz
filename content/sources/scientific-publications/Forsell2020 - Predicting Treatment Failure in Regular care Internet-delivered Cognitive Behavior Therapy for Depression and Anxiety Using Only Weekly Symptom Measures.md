# Example citation

Weekly symptom ratings have been used to predict treatment success or failure (neither treatment response nor remission status), with accuracy above chance (50%) at week 1, and accuracy above therapist predictions (65%) at weeks 5-6 [@forsell2020]

# Key takeaways
* Internetpsychiatry clinic: depression, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder
* n = 4310
* Self-rated measurements (MADRS-S, PDSS-SR, LSAS-SR)
* Additive regression models were used to predict a post-treatment score (screening + pre-treatment + week 1 + week 2...)
