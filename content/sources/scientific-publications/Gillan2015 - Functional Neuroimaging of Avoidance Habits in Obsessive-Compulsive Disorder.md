They wanted to determine neural correlates of excessive habit formation in OCD. OCD-patients had a hyperactivation in the caudate nucleus during the learning phase.

> OCD patients exhibited excessive habits that
    were associated with hyperactivation in a key region implicated
    in the pathophysiology of OCD, the caudate nucleus. Previous
    studies indicate that this region is important for goal-directed
    behavior, suggesting that habit-forming biases in OCD may be
    a result of impairments in this system, rather than differences in
    the buildup of stimulus-response habits themselves.

Recent research into habit formation and goal-directed behavior in OCD has found that excessive habit formation may result from deficits in the goal-directed system.

Three very interesting regions:

- Medial orbitofrontal cortex
- Caudate nucleus
- Putamen

> Generally, the habit hypothesis of OCD exhibits good
    [[face validity]] in that both habits and compulsions continue in
    spite of awareness that these actions are not useful/wanted
    (i.e., [[ego-dystonic]]) and are associated with the experience
    of an urge to perform them (6).

## Methods

Participants were instructed to avoid getting shocks for a few trials, then researchers showed to the patients how they disconnected one of the electrodes. This "outcome devaluation" was then a measure of excessive habit formation. Did the OCD patients continue avoiding shocks to the wrist that had been disconnected even though it didn't matter anymore?

## Results

So OCD patients responded more to devalued stimuli and had higher urges. BUT! More than half (21 out of 37) in the OCD group did not show excessive habit formation.

## Discussion

> Habits in OCD were associated with hyperactivation in the
    caudate nucleus. Specifically, greater caudate activity was
    observed in patients whose actions had become habitual,
    compared with healthy comparison subjects and OCD
    patients who did not form habits. Independent analysis
    revealed that, across the entire OCD group, greater activation
    in this region was correlated with the self-reported
    urge to perform these habits; there was no such relationship
    in healthy comparison subjects.

> Hyperactivation in the caudate is one of the most consistent
    neurobiological markers of OCD symptoms (with medial
    orbitofrontal cortex hyperactivation being the other) (18, 19),
    and our data therefore lend strong support to a model of
    OCD centered on deficits in goal-directed control over actions,
    resulting in compulsive habits.

## Conclusions

> These data implicate dysfunction in regions that support
    goal-directed control over action in excessive habit formation
    in OCD. These data also add convergent support to the
    habit hypothesis of OCD, such that it exhibits excellent neurobiological
    convergence with the known pathophysiology
    of OCD.
