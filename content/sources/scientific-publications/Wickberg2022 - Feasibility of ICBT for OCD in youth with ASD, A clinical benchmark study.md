The initial results of an internet-delivered adapted CBT for OCD in youth with co-occurring ASD has shown encouraging results (within-group effect size *d* = 1.33) [@wickberg2022].

# Key takeaways
* n = 22
* CY-BOCS within-group *d* = 1.33, 60% responders, 50% remission.
	* mean 21.7 at pre, 12.2 at post
* Modules 1-3 trained participants to distinguish OCD from ASD symptoms. Modules 4-13 ERP and module 14 relapse prevention.
* ASD adaptations:
	* Visual support
	* Time aids
	* Regulate strong feelings
	* Facilitate generalization
	* Reduce mental rigidity during ERP
* High parental involvement (parent modules too)
* Patients completed on average 6.41 modules only.
* Therapist time in ICBT = 3h 15 min, in F2F = 28h
