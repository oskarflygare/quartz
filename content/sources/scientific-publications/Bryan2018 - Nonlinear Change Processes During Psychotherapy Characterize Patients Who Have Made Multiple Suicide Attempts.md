# Example citation

[[Individuals with multiple suicide attempts have a tendency to 'get stuck' in states of more intense suicide ideation, whereas individuals with no or one attempt stabilize at a state of low risk]]

# Key takeaways
* n = 76 (active duty US army soldiers)
* Participants received brief CBT for acute suicide risk
* Multiple attempters (42.1%) / first-time attempters (43.4%) / ideators (14.5%)
* They used *only* item 9 from the BDI to assess suicide ideation.
* Multiple attempters showed more of a *cusp catastrophe* pattern than did first-time attempters or ideators, but it's not as clear as Figure 2.
* A cusp catastrophe strucutre is found when a cubic effect is significant, and a significant *bifurcation* parameter in the model, both of which should contribute beyond a linear/quadratic model fit.

> All three groups had attractor set points at a low level of suicide ideation (x < 0.35), which suggests that, regardless of suicide attempt history, suicide ideation tended to be drawn toward and stabilize at a relatively low-risk state.

> Multiple attempters also had a second attractor set point at a high level of suicide ideation (x3 = 2.25), however, indicating that suicide ideation tended to be drawn toward and stabilize at a relatively high-risk state as well.

> Consistent with a cusp catastrophe model, in between these two stable states was a repeller set point from which suicide ideation was pushed away (x2 = 1.65), which indicates that suicide ideation tended to be unstable at moderate levels of risk.

So for multiple attempters, there are several points along the X-axis where the predicted change score is 0. This indicates that there are multiple "stable states".

> Negative slopes suggest an attractor set point (i.e., stable states), whereas the positive slope suggest a repeller set point (i.e., an unstable state)
