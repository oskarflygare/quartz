# Example citation

Moment-to-moment mood connections are stronger in individuals with a mental disorder, suggesting that those individuals are susceptible to downward spirals of negative mental states [@wigman2015].

# Key takeaways
* Experience Sampling Method dataset, n = 599
	* Depression
	* Psychotic disorder
	* No diagnosis
* Top-down: mental states *cheerful, content, down, insecure, suspicious* were compared
* Bottom-up: PCA to see if network structures clustered
	* *qgraph* used to display networks
* **Results:** Stronger moment-to-moment connections in both diagnostic groups. Seven main components from the PCA.
	* [[Moment-to-moment mood connections are stronger in individuals with a mental disorder, suggesting that those individuals are susceptible to downward spirals of negative mental states]]
* I didn't really understand the bottom-up stuff. Results were difficult to interpret.

> Networks of individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis contained loops which may catch individuals into a downward spiral of negative mental states.

LOTS of pooled small studies

## Stronger between-mood links in depression

I think this is interesting, and kind of resonates with how we view depression. You can get "stuck" in negative mood states and not respond adequately to external changes. [[Tipping point]] into negative mood states.
