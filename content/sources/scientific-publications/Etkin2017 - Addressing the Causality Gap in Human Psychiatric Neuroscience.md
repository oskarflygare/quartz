## Why and when I was reading this


### Key takeaways
*  His main point is that neuroimaging methods like fMRI demonstrate correlation but not causation. We should therefore be very careful in interpreting these results, and move towards more experimental manipulation.
* Dysfunctions across disorders are more similar than previously thought. Demonstrating that [[OCD]] cases and healthy controls differ in imaging studies does not necessarily point to specific alterations in OCD but psychopathology more general.
* We do not know whether different treatments exert their effects through common or specific brain pathways.

    Some suggestions:
- Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one way to experimentally manipulate brain functioning.
- RCTs with mechanistic hypotheses and incorporation of neural mechanisms are needed

        In fact, neuroimaging meta- analyses across psychiatric disorders have found more neural similarities than differences between disorders, despite their divergent symptoms.

        Simply put, our dominant tool, neuroimag- ing, demonstrates correlations, ultimately revealing associations but not demonstrating by itself how a cir- cuit perturbation causes aberrant behavior and symp- toms.

        Causal neurostimulation tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) allow researchers to ma- nipulate the function of targeted regions and their con- nected neural networks for periods that range from mil- liseconds to weeks.

        Nonetheless, it is also important to realize that some of the strongest correlations may lack any causal rela- tionships

        s valuable as these de- velopments might be in providing patients with additional treatment options, it is nonetheless important to acknowledge that a great deal of effort has gone into treatment development without an understand- ing of whether the neural mechanisms they treat are indeed different.

        Greater use of mechanistic comparative trials is ethical and can advance clinical outcomes by revealing the true factors affect- ing who responds and why.
