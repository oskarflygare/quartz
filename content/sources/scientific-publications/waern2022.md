# Example citation

[[Individuals who self-harm with fluctuating suicidal intent are at higher risk of subsequent suicide attempts]]

# My notes
- They compared 1-year outcomes in individuals with NSSI only, NSSI + SA, and SA only (n = 793)
- Risk of future SA is 3-fold in the mixed NSSI+SA group compared to NSSI only (OR = 3.37, *p* = .002).
- The most common psychiatric diagnoses were depressive episode (72%) and anxiety disorder (56%). Over 50% live alone.

> Switching between episodes with and without suicidal intent was common in the adult clinical cohort studied, and this pattern was associated with elevated risk of future suicidal behavior.

> Our results regarding both previous and subsequent self-harm behaviors underline the fluctuating nature of suicidal intent in adult self-harm.
