# Example citation

An exploratory analysis of symptom networks in OCD found that negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts were the most central symptoms [@olatunji2019]

# Key takeaways
* OCD sample (n = 150), other primary diagnoses (n = 114), unselected nonclinical sample (n = 310).
* [[OCI-R]] and Obsessional Beliefs Questoinnaire-44
* Negative appraisals of intrusive thoughts were the most central symptoms: “Having intrusive thoughts means I’m out of control” and “Having nasty thoughts means I am a terrible person”. Hoarding symptoms in the OCI-R peripheral to the network.
* Do central symptoms predict OCD severity and other clinical variables better than non-central symptoms? They used the top two central compared to the least central symptoms, to predict YBOCS/BDI/STAI values. Very poor prediction of YBOCS (R^2 = 0.03)

Why select other samples than OCD? Because [[cognitive biases]] like [[Intolerance of uncertainty]] are dimensional constructs present in all individuals to some extent. Including nonclinical participants may aid in constructing the network for OCD.

[[Network edges]], where symptoms ([[Network nodes]]) influence each other, can work both via activation (pathological network) and also via deactivation (healthy network). So it might be a good clue as to which symptoms to prioritize in treatment.

The OBQ-44 has three main factors:
- Responsibility/Threat estimation
- Perfectionism/certainty
- Importance/control of thoughts

## Methods

Only one item reflecting each construct, otherwise highly correlated items will inflate centrality estimates. See picture below for the ones selected from OCI-R.
