# Example citation

Machine learning techniques have been used to predict the two-year remission status of patients with OCD, yielding a balanced accuracy of 72% in test data [@grassi2021].

# Key takeaways
* Gradient boosted decision trees (XGBoost in R)
* n = 287, AUROC 0.78 (sens 73% spec 71%)
* Small test data sites and large variations between sites.
