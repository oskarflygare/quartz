# Example citation

In a pilot study, 3 to 5 face-to-face sessions of CBT were followed by weekly phone calls and free use of a smartphone app designed to facilitate ERP exercises. After 8 weeks of treatment, 42% of participants were classified as treatment responders [@gershkovich2021].

# Key takeaways
* n = 33 adults with OCD.
* 3-5 face-to-face sessions and then weekly phone calls + nOCD app use
* 14 (42%) responders, 8 (24%) remission at post-treatment.
