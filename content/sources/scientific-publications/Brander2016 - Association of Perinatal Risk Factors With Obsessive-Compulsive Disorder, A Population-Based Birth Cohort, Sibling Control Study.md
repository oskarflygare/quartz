# Example citation

Multiple perinatal risk factors are associated with OCD (e.g., maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, delivery by cesarean section) after controlling for shared familial confounders, and there is a dose-response association between the number of perinatal evens and OCD risk [@brander2016a].

# Key takeaways
* Exposures: maternal smoking during pregnancy, labor presentation, obstetric delivery, gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, head circumference
* Control for shared familial confounders and sex, year of birth, maternal and paternal age at birth, and parity.
* Risk factors: Smoking ≥10 cigarettes per day during pregnancy, breech presentation, delivery by cesarean section, preterm birth, low birth weight, and Apgar distress scores.
* Dose-response association between the number of perinatal events and increased OCD risk.
