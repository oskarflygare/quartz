## Why and when I was reading this
I was doing a deep-dive into [[Compulsivity]]

### Key takeaways
* "In conclusion, we have identified hypoactivation in the DLPFC as a candidate neurocognitive endophenotype for OCD. Associated aberrant coupling with the putamen might predispose toward excessive habit formation and suboptimal goal-directed performance" So again, the excessive [[Habits]] theory of [[OCD]]

They tested patients with [[OCD]], their unaffected first-degree relatives and controls (n = 20 in all groups) on an executive functioning task. **OCD patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives had hypoactivation of the dorsolateral PFC during goal-directed planning, and reduced coupling between dorsolateral PFC and putamen.**

 p.655: The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have been postulated to result from impaired executive functioning and excessive habit formation at the expense of goal-directed control and have been objectively demonstrated using neuropsychological tests in such patients. This study tested whether there is functional hypoactivation as well as dysconnectivity of discrete frontostriatal pathways during goal-directed planning in patients with OCD and in their unaffected first-degree relatives. -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.655: Patients with OCD and their clinically asymptomatic relatives manifested hypoactivation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during goal-directed planning coupled with reduced functional connectivity between this cortical region and the basal ganglia (putamen) -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.655: Hypoactivation of cortical regions associated with goal-directed planning and associated frontostriatal dysconnectivity represent a candidate endophenotype for OCD. These findings accord with abnormalities in neural networks supporting the balance between goal-directed and habitual behavior, with implications for recent neuropsychological theories of OCD and the major neurobiological model for this disorder. -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.655: The major neurobiological model for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) implies functional abnormalities within frontostriatal circuits (1). These circuits are crucial for enabling the successful implementation of flexible, goal-directed behavior (2). -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.655: exaggerated appetitive (4) and aversive (5) habit learning in OCD has been shown, also compatible with abnormal activity of corticostriatal circuits affecting the balance between goaldirected and habitual behavior (6,7). -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.656: Our investigation was based on substantial overlap between the neural circuitry typically recruited during the execution of goal-directed planning and the frontostriatal circuitry implicated in OCD according to the prevailing neurobiological model -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.656: Moreover, extending the frontostriatal model for OCD (1), dysfunctional interactions between cortical and subcortical nodes, rather than damage to individual brain regions, have been hypothesized as a potential determinant of OCD (22). -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.657: Previous studies have demonstrated caudate activation in association with planning (25–27) and reduced activation in caudate and putamen during planning in patients with OCD (19). -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.660: Here, we independently replicated those findings and provided new evidence that the same pattern of hypoactivation in the DLPFC characterizes patients with OCD and their relatives alike, suggesting a common weak frontal neural recruitment during goaldirected planning. -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.660: Therefore, goaldirected planning hypoactivation of the DLPFC and associated frontostriatal connectivity were identified as a hitherto undiscovered candidate endophenotype for OCD. -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.661: Our results further demonstrate that while OCD pathophysiology is traditionally linked to the orbitofrontal circuit (6), it is likely associated with a more distributed network (34). -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.661: We hypothesize that enhanced functioning of the putamen might be linked to an exaggerated habitual tendency observed in OCD (4,5). -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017

        p.662: In conclusion, we have identified hypoactivation in the DLPFC as a candidate neurocognitive endophenotype for OCD. Associated aberrant coupling with the putamen might predispose toward excessive habit formation and suboptimal goal-directed performance -- Highlighted 30 nov. 2017
