## Example citation
The GAD-7 is a 7-item anxiety scales that measures common symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder in the last two weeks [@spitzer2006]. Each item ranges from 0 "not at all" to 3 "nearly every day", resulting in a total score of 0-21.

The GAD-7 has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha$ = 0.92) and convergent validity (correlation with the Beck Anxiety Inventory *r* = 0.72) [@spitzer2006].
