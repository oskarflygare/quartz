# My notes

- In many fields the majority of studies are either conceptual or simulation studies. 
- Their review questions:
	- *Which are the complex systems of interest?*
	- *Which type of disturbance affect the system?*
	- *Which are the main dimensions of resilience?*
	- *Which are the main attributes of the system affecting resilience?*
- Sweden is pretty active in this domain, only behind USA and Canada.

Only 5 papers from psychology were included. It's probably because they include both resilience and complex system in the search, and most psychology papers have only the former.

# Abstract
This paper reviews the state of the art on the resilience of complex systems by embracing different research areas and using bibliometric tools. The aim is to identify the main intellectual communities and leading scholars and to synthesize key knowledge of each research area. We also carry out a comparison across the research areas, aimed at analyzing how resilience is approached in any field, how the topic evolved starting from the ecological field of study, and the level of cross-fertilization among domains. Our analysis shows that resilience of complex systems is a multidisciplinary concept, which is particularly important in the fields of environmental science, ecology, and engineering. Areas of recent and increasing interest are also operation research, management science, business, and computer science. Except for environmental science and ecology, research is fragmented and carried out by isolated research groups. Integration is not only limited inside each field but also between research areas. In particular, we trace the citation links between different research areas and find a very limited number, revealing a scarce cross-fertilization among domains. We conclude by providing some directions for future research.
