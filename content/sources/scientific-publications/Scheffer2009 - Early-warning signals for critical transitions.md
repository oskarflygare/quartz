# Key takeaways
* [[Critical slowing down]] can be used to understand how close the system is to a [[Tipping point]]
* Hours before epileptic seizures, small seizures (unnoticeable to the patient) can occur in smaller regions of the brain.
> This resembles patterns of flickering in which smaller transient excursions to the vicinity of an alternative state precede the upcoming major shift.
* How can these predictions fail?
	* There can be another extreme rare event that triggers a transition
	* Fast and permanent change of external conditions
	* False positives: early-warning sign by chance or confounder within the system or external factors

> In conclusion, most early-warning signals are indicators of proximity to a broad class of thresholds, where small forces can cause major changes in the state of a complex system.

> Thus, although a trend in the indicators may serve as a warning, the actual moment of a transition remains difficult to predict. A key issue when it comes to practical application is the question of whether a signal can be detected sufficiently early for action to be taken to prevent a transition or to prepare for one.
