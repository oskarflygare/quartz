# My notes
- The authors describe a Bayesian account of OCD. Inability to rely on top-down predictions (hands are clean after washing, but no sensory input confirms it for me) makes OCD patients over-reliant on habits.
- Compulsions can go from goal-directed to habitual over time.

> Compulsions can be both attempts to reduce overestimated threat, and expressions of inflexible habits. Both proximal causes stem from the same core impairment (unreliable predictive models) and differentiating them becomes a question of context (e.g., some contexts encourage habit formation more than others), rather than a theoretical stance.
