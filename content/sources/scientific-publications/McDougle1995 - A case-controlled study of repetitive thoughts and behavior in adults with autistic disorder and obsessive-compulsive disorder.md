They wanted to compare the types of repetitive thoughts and behavior in ASD to OCD. 50 ASD-patients completed the YBOCS checklist.

**Less common in ASD:**

- Aggressive, contamination, sexual, religious, symmetry and somatic obsessions (not hoarding or need to know/remember obsessions)
- Cleaning, checking, counting compulsions

**More common in ASD:**
	- Ordering, hoarding, telling or asking, touching, tapping or rubbing, self-damaging or self-mutilating behavior

> These results suggest that the repetitive thoughts and behavior characteristic of autism differ significantly from the obsessive-compulsive symptoms displayed by patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
  
After some kind of "**stepwise discriminant function analysis",** the authors find that aggressive thoughts are the strongest predictor of OCD rather than ASD. Hoarding and self-damaging behavior is the strongest indicator of ASD rather than OCD.
