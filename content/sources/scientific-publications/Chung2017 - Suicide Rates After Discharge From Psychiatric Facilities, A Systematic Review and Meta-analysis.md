The risk of suicide among patients admitted to inpatient psychiatric care is highest immediately after discharge [@chung2017]

[[Patients recently discharged from psychiatric facilities have almost 200 times increased risk of suicide compared to the global rate]]

# Key takeaways
* *k* = 100 studies, a total of 17857 reported suicides
* Pooled suicide rate = 484 suicides per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 422 - 555)
* Highest suicide rate <3 months after discharge (1132, 95% CI 1512 - 2856). This is almost 200 times the global rate (11.4 per 100k person-years).
	* 3m to 12m = 654
	* 1y to 5y = 494
	* 5y to 10y = 366
	* >10y = 277
