- Correlation _r_ = 0.50 between SNP-based heritability and heritability estimated from family-based registries, when leaving out [[OCD]]. OCD likely ruined the correlation since the OCD cases in the genetic studies are "multiplex", i.e. families with particularly high burden and severe cases.
- Family-based heritability estimates were generally larger, meaning that SNP likely does not capture all of the heritability (the rest may come from rare variants for example
- Genetics are most important in [[ASD]], ADHD, Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia
-   Environment more important in Alcohol dependence, Anorexia, Major Depresison, OCD
