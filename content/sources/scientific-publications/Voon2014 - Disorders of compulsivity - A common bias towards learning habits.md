## Why and when I was reading this
I was doing a deep dive into the role of [[Habits]] in [[OCD]]

### Key takeaways
* Goal-directed versus habitual [[decision making]]
* Disorders involving an over-emphasis on [[Habits]] to create repetitive behaviors: binge eating disorder, addiction, and [[OCD]]
* three

## Summary

- Shift from goal-directed behaviour to habit formation early in learning a new problem.

        Why do we repeat choices that we know are bad for us? Decision making is characterized by the parallel engagement of two distinct systems, goal-directed and habitual

        The habitual system is a candidate source of pathological fi xedness. Using a decision task that measures the contribution to learning of either mechanism, we show a bias towards model-free (habit) acquisition in disorders involving both natural (binge eating) and artifi cial (methamphetamine) rewards, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This favoring of model-free learning may underlie the repetitive behaviors that ultimately dominate in these disorders. Further, we show that the habit formation bias is associated with lower gray matter volumes in caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our fi ndings suggest that the dysfunction in a common neurocomputational mechanism may underlie diverse disorders involving compulsion.

        This relationship suggests a possible role for top-down volitional control in decreasing habit formation.

        Our results also implicate defi ned neural substrates in these effects. We show that in HVs, lower gray matter volumes in the caudate, medial OFC and lateral prefrontal cortices were asso- ciated with a greater shift towards model-free habit formation
