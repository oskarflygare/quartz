# Example citation

Polygenic risk scores for OCD significantly predict obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the population [@denbraber2016].

# Key takeaways
* n = 6931
* Heritability of OCS 0.42, SNP-based heritability 14%
* OCD PRS predicted OCS in their sample

> First, in line with previous studies, we estimated the heritability for OCS at 0.42.4 Stability of OCS over a 6-year time period was 0.63, and cross-twin–cross-time correlations were found to be twice as high in MZ compared with DZ/sib pairs, indicating that the observed stability is mainly caused by genetic factors. Bivariate analyses showed a longitudinal genetic correlation of 0.58. Second, polygenic scores based on a GWA analysis of clinical OCD cases significantly predicted OCS in the independent population-based sample.
