- Treatment: A combination of [[ERP]] and applied behavior analysis for children with ASD and compulsive behavior.
- They used only the compulsions part of CY-BOCS, CY-BOCS not administered at follow-up
- Some of these behaviors were not "OCD-like", for example touching fingers in rapid succession. Others were more like classic OCD, for example asking for reassurance about scars or minor marks on body.
- It is unclear what "Treatment As Usual" means in this study
