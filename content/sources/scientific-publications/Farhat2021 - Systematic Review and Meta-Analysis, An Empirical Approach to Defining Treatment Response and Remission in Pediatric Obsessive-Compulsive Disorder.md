# Example citation
A meta-analysis found that a ≥35% reduction on the C-YBOCS, and a score of ≤12 best corresponded to treatment response and remission, respectively, defined as a score of 1 or 2 on the CGI-I/CGI-S [@farhat2021].

# Key takeaways
* 42 RCTs, n = 1234
* ROC-curves with AUC and Youden Index as outcome measures
* Treatment response (35% reduction) AUC = 0.89. Sensitivity 83.9, specificity 81.7
* Remission status (12 points or lower) AUC = 0.92. Sensitivity 82.0, specificity 84.6

It's very neat that they found exactly the corresponding figures as the adult version in [[Mataix-Cols2016 - Towards an international expert consensus for defining treatment response, remission, recovery and relapse in obsessive-compulsive disorder]]
