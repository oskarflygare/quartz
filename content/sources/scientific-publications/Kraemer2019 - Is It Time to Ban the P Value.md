## Why and when I was reading this
I was following up on the [[p-value]] debate.

### Key takeaways
* Readers need to look beyond p-values and evaluate study quality and effect sizes instead
* P-values largely depend on sample size, so in very large studies everything will be significant
* P-values should be reported to *a priori* hypotheses

The reason people are criticizing the [[p-value]] is that it is misused, miscomputed, and misinterpreted.

A valid p-value has a distribution which is determined by sample size, reliability of sensitivity of the measures used, quality of the design and analyses, and quality of the research in general.

Even though a p-value might be well below 0.05 it may still lack clinical relevance, because in large studies even trivial differences yield low p-values.

In contrast, effect sizes remain the same regardless of sample size.

The author suggests a 3-part strategy.

## Each p-value should be reported after *a priori* justification for its hypothesis

So a call for proper pre-registration of studies.

We shouldn't do mass testing with p-values and pretend that all of those tests were created equal.

## P-values should always be accompanied by descriptive statistics
Preferably, an effect size with confidence intervals.

## Exploratory studies and tests should not report p-values
