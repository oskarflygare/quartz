# My notes
- *k* = 14 studies, *n* = 4398
- Overall effect: *g* = -0.18 (95% CI -0.27 to -0.10)
	- Larger effect of interventions that directly targeted suicidality, *g* = -0.23 (95% CI -0.35 to -0.11) and no effect of depression interventions (*g* = -0.12, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.01)
- Very small effects on suicidal plans and suicidal ideation in each individual study.
