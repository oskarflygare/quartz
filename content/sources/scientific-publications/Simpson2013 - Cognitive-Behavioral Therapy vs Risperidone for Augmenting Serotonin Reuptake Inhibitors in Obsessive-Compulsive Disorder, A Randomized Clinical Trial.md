# Example citation
EX/RP is a more effective augmentation to SRIs than risperidone [@simpson2013].

Risperidone did not outperform pill placebo as an augmentation of treatment with SRIs [@simpson2013]

# Key takeaways
* All patients had SRI treatment for at least 12 weeks with moderate OCD. n = 100
* Risperidone (8 weeks trt, n = 40) vs EX/RP (17 sessions 2/week, n = 40) vs placebo (n = 20)
* EX/RP outperformed risperidone YBOCS -9.72 (SE = 1.38), risperidone did *not* perform better than placebo.
* Responders: 80% EX/RP, 23% risperidone, 15% placebo. Remission 43% EX/RP, 13% risperidone, 5% placebo

> Adding EX/RP to SRIs was superior to risperidone and pill placebo in reducing OCD symptoms and improving insight, functioning, and quality of life. Risperidone was not superior to placebo on any outcome.
