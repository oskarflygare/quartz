# Example citation

[[Suicidal ideation varies dramatically even during short time-spans]]

# Key takeaways
* Study 1: 54 adults who had attempted suicide in the previous year, 28 days of EMA
* Study 2: 36 psychiatric inpatients admitted for suicide risk, EMA during their stay (average 10.32 days)
* Large variability in suicidal ideation, around 1/4 of ratings differed by more than 1 SD from the previous rating
* Known risk factors also showed large variability, but did not predict short-term change in suicidal ideation. When controlling for suicide ideation at T, the risk factors at T did not predict suicidal ideation at T+1.

## EMA items
- Desire to die by suicide (0-4)
- Intention to die by suicide (0-4)
- Ability to resist the urge to die by suicide (0-4)
- Affect labels rated 0-4. hopelessness, burdensome, lonely

## Statistical methods
- 1-ICC to get the proportion of variance due to within-individual differences
- Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) to see variability over time
	- Higher suicidal ideation was correlated with higher RMSSD, likely because individuals with low suicidal ideation had floor effects on their ratings.
