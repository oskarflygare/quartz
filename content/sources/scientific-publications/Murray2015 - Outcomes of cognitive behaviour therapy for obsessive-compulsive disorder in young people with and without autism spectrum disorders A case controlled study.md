## Why and when I was reading this


### Key takeaways
* Symptom reduction, but low rates of remission in the group with OCD and ASD

---
> Overall, it is challenging to compare the results of the aforementioned studies as the demographics of the participants, tools for measuring diagnosis and criteria for determening response and remission rates vary. The question of how effective CBT is for paediatric OCD within the context of ASD, therefore remains unanswered.

## Main results

They compared outcomes after CBT for OCD in young people with OCD + ASD to young people with OCD but not ASD.

- OCD + ASD: 38% symptom reduction, 9% remission at post
- OCD + NoASD: 48% symptom reduction, 46% remission at post
