# Example citation

In a Bayesian network of OCD and depression, distress from obsessions acted as a bridge symptom between OCD and depression, activating sadness and subsequently the rest of the depressive cluster [@mcnally2017].

# Key takeaways
* Patients with primary OCD and depressive symptoms, n = 408
* Y-BOCS-SR and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR)
* Graphical LASSO algorithm and DAG using a Bayesian network approach
* Interference & distress from obsessions, and interference from compulsions are most central in OCD
* Distress from obsessions -> Sadness -> rest of depression cluster (**bridge symptom**) in DAG
