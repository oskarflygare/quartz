# Abstract
BackgroundRepetition of self-poisoning is common.AimsTo report the 24-month outcomes of a non-obligatory postcard intervention (plus treatment as usual) compared with treatment as usual.MethodIn a randomised-controlled trial (Zelen design) conducted in Newcastle, Australia, eight postcards were sent to participants over a 12-month period. The principal outcomes were the proportion of participants with one or more repeat episodes of self-poisoning and the number of repeat episodes per person.ResultsNo significant reduction was observed in the proportion of people repeating self-poisoning in the intervention group (21.2%, 95% CI 17.0–25.3) compared with the control group (22.8%, 95% CI 18.7–27.0; χ2=0.32, d.f. = 1, P= 0.57); the difference between groups was −1.7% (95% CI −7.5 to 4.2). There was a significant reduction in the rate of repetition, with an incidence risk ratio of 0.49 (95% CI 0.33–0.73).ConclusionsA postcard intervention maintained the halving of the rate of repetition of hospital-treated self-poisoning events over a 2-year period, although it did not significantly reduce the proportion of individuals who repeated self-poisoning.
