# Key takeaways
* They review a bunch of recent advances
	* clinical neuroscience and personalized pharmacotherapy. RDoC - [[Insel2015 - Brain disorders Precisely]]
	* novel statistical approaches to psychiatric nosology, notably [[Network theory of psychopathology]] and HiTOP [[krueger_2018_progress_in_achieving_quantitative_classification_of_psychopathology.pdf]]
	* deinstitutionalization and community mental health care
	* scale-up of evidence-based psychotherapy, lots of [[IAPT]] talk
	* digital phenotyping and digital therapies (both ICBT and smartphone apps)
	* global mental health and task-sharing approaches
* I'll read the parts that are unfamiliar and summarize below.

## Deinstitutionalization and community mental health care
- First half of 1900s saw growth of psychiatric hospitals
- 80-90% reduction in many western countries between mid 1950s and 1990s
- Three components
	- Discharging patients from hospitals to community care
	- Diverting new admissions to alternative facilities
	- Community-based services
- What were the forces behind this change?
	- [[The driving forces behind deinstitutionalization in psychiatry was access to better medication, high costs of psychiatric hospitals, and public concerns about the practices in psychiatric hospitals]]
	- Medications made it possible for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder to live reasonably well in community settings
	- High costs of psychiatric hospitals
	- Human rights movement in 1950s-1960s -> increasing public concern about what was going on in psychiatric institutions. *One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest* and other movies generated public attention.
- Deinstitutionalization is not seen in the same extent in low-income countries, where psychiatric beds are increasing.
- Success of deinstitutionalization is varied. When things go poorly we see "revolving door" patterns of care: acute episodes lead to inpatient care, discharge without appropriate care and support in the community, relapse and readmission.
- Some arguments around community-based care and the underlying structural issues that should be addressed, e.g. [[Lower demand for psychological treatments, due to non-medical interpretations of symptoms and structural issues in underserved areas, should not be ignored]]

## Digital phenotyping and digital therapies

- CCTV images to identify suicide attempts in progress at hotspots (ref 160)
- Refs 81-83 seem interesting

> The ability to access, store and manipulate data, together with the use of machine learning algorithms, promises to advance the practice of individualized medicine in psychiatry by allowing matching of patients with the most appropriate therapies

- Active data collection vs passive data collection
	- Passive data collection can be used for *digital phenotyping*
- Limitations in app-based trt (beyond security issues and lack of evidence-base)
	- High data costs
	- Unstable Internet connections
	- Bandwidth limitations
