[[DBT-A leads to long-term cost savings compared to treatment as usual due to fewer inpatient and emergency visits]]

# My notes

- n = 77
- Lifetime Parasuicide Count interview and CGAS were health outcomes
- Costs were therapy sessions, use of other health services, and medication
- DBT-A incurred higher treatment costs €2981 (95% CI -4666 to 10629), the treatment costs for DBT-A were €15850
- €-10787 difference during follow-up, the TAU group had higher costs because of two very long inpatient stays.
	- Because of this, DBT-A is associated with higher efficacy and *less* cost, which is counter intuitive.

> “Using self-harm as effect outcome measure, the probability of DBT being cost-effective compared to EUC increased with increasing willingness to pay up to a ceiling of 99.5% (threshold of € 1400), while with CGAS as effect outcome measure, this ceiling was 94.9% (threshold of € 1600).”
