# Key takeaways
* n = 2090 Swedish individuals with OCD
* Narrow-sense heritability was 29% (SE = 4%). Common variants (1-5%) accounted for 10% of heritability, so rare variants (<1%) contribute meaningfully to the heritability
* When you look at twin studies the heritability estimates are higher, and this is likely because you get both rare and common variants. In SNP based analyses you only have common variants.
