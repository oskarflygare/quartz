# Example citation
Unmedicated OCD-patients show alterations in functional connectivity between the default mode and salience networks, which contributes to decreased sustained attention in OCD [@posner2017].

# Key takeaways
* OCD patients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 32) were compared on functional connectivity, default mode network vs salience network.
* OCD symptoms associated with an imbalance between the default mode and salience networks, which has a negative impact on sustained attention.
* Conner's Continuous Performance Test (the one I used with ADHD children at KIND)
