# Key takeaways
* Two treatment *selection* strategies: stepped care and stratified care
	* Stratified care selection was based on machine-learning algorithm
	* Input into ML algorithm: PHQ-9, GAD-7, WSAS, personality, demographics
	* "Poor expected prognosis" get high-intensity right away
* Low-intensity care is 8 30min sessions with a PWP. High-intensity care is up to 20 1 hour sessions with HI-CBT.
	* But high-intensity interventions were messy and included a bunch of things like EMDR, experiential counseling.
	* "Consistent with the pragmatic trial design, we did not record, monitor, or modify these interventions in any way to preserve the integrity of routinely delivered psychological care"
* Randomization per therapist, so 15 therapists in each arm
* Logistic regression on proportion of clinically significant improvement, full CEA analysis
* n = 951
* Proportion improved 52.3% in stratified care, 45.1% in stepped care. OR = 1.40 (95% CI 1.02 - 1.87).
	* In their power calculation they expected an OR of 2.2 but wanted to have power for the complex cases too (expected to be 30% of sample). So they powered for 760 cases. Why did they end up with 951, seems like a very big overshoot? And the significance is *just* beyond the threshold...
* Higher cost for stratified care because 57% received high intensity treatment right away, versus 29.1% in stepped-care group.
* Their strengths of stratified care
	* Improved outcomes through personalized treatment selection
	* Feasibility to implement the model (high adherence)
	* More efficient clinician assessments compared to stepped-care

Author conclusion:
> In this cluster randomized clinical trial of adults with common mental disorders, stratified care was efficacious and cost-effective for the treatment of depression symptoms compared with stepped care. Stratified care can improve depression treatment outcomes at a modest additional cost.

So they are seeing that stratified care is likely more expensive since not all patients in stepped-care need high-intensity trt, but they argue that it gets better results. What do I believe will be true for BDD? Stepped-care likely to be pretty good since we have the BDD-NET.
