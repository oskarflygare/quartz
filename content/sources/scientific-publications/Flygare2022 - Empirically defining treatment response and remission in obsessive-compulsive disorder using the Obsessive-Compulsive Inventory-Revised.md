[[46.04 - Response to reviewer comments]]

- Hoarding subscale, OCI-12
	- Yea would have been prefereable, but we will most likely not have access to item-level or subscale-level data from all trials. If anything this should mean that we underestimate the accuracy of the full OCI-R and that similar evaluations using the OCI-12 will have higher accuracy.
- ROC-concepts
	- sens/spec
		- This is with the “true” values as vantage point. How many *true* cases will we identify (sensitivity) and how many *true* non-cases will we exclude (specificity)?
	- PPV/NPV
		- This is with our prediction as vantage point. When we say that there is a case, how many times is that prediction correct (PPV), when we say that there is no-case how often is that prediction correct (NPV)?
	- Accuracy/Cohen's kappa/AUC
		- Accuracy is the proportion of correct classifications
		- Cohen’s kappa ranges 0-1, where 0 is not better than what would have occured by chance, and 1 is perfect agreement. Kappa is higher if there are multiple available categories, so our binary classifications likely does not overstate the predictive power at least.
		-  0–0.20 as slight, 0.21–0.40 as fair, 0.41–0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial, and 0.81–1 as almost perfect agreement (Landis & Koch cut-offs)
