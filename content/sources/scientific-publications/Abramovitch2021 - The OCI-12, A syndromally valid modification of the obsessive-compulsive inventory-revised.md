# Example citation

A shorter version of the OCI-R, the OCI-12, excludes the hoarding and neutralizing subscales and has similar psychometric properties compared to the full OCI-R scale [@abramovitch2021a] 

# Key takeaways
* Four core OCD dimensions in factor analyses of OCD (checking, ordering, washing, obsessing)
* OCI-R includes hoarding and neutralizing as well
* OCD patients (n = 1087), other anxiety disorders (n = 1306), community volunteers (n = 423)
* Cronbach's alpha = 0.79 (but lower than OCI-R = 0.83)
* Two-week test-retest reliability *r* = 0.74
* Correlation with OCI-R score *r* = 0.93
* Similar sensitivity to treatment as the OCI-R, both had *d* = 1.89 when YBOCS was *d* = 2.59
* Cut-off for OCD vs non-clinical community sample = 11 (83% sens 81% spec)
* Cut-off for OCD vs other anx = 14 (72% sens 73% spec)
* 0-12 mild, 13-21 moderate, 22-48 severe

In their analyses they removed hoarding from the beginning, and evaluated whether the neutralizing factor was an appropriate addition.
