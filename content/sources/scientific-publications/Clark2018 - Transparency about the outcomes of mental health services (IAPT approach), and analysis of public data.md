## Example citation

An analysis of publicly available data from the IAPT programme found that several organisation-level factors predicted the rate of reliable improvement and reliable recovery, and that changes in these factors could account for 22-33% of the variance in outcomes the following fiscale year [@clark2018].

More treatment sessions, fewer missed appointments and shorter waiting times for treatment predicted clinical outcomes in an analysis of public IAPT data [@clark2018].

### Key takeaways
* Positive associations with outcomes: % cases with a problem descriptor (diagnosis), n treatment sessions, % referrals treated
* Negative associations: Time waited to start treatment, % appointments missed
* However, VERY small effect sizes (OR 1.002 to 1.077) that are significant due to the huge dataset.
* The organisational factors predicted 2014 -> 2015 changes in outcomes, R2 for reliable improvement = 0.33, R2 for reliable recovery = 0.22.
* Patient-level data was not available.

Predictors of *variability* in clinical performance. So service-level analysis.

Outcomes were reliable improvement and reliable recovery
