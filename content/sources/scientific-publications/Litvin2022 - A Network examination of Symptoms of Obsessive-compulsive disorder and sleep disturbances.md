# Example citation

In patients with primary OCD and no MDD, there were weak associations between symptoms of insomnia and OCD [@litvin2022].

# Key takeaways
* Rogers Behavioral Health, n = 773
* This is [[Peer-review report JOCRD-D-21-00223R1]] & [[Peer-review report JOCRD-D-21-00223R2]]
	* My main critique is that they had a very low cut-off on the QIDS-SR so there would be low scores on the insomnia items by default. No wonder they don't find any strong associations
