# Example citation

An open trial of self-guided use of a smartphone app using ERP found a small reduction in symptoms from pre-treatment (21.3) to post-treatment (17.9) on the self-rated YBOCS [@boisseau2017].

# Key takeaways
* 12-week app only, LiveOCDFree. n = 21 participants with mild to moderate OCD (using SCID). But they could not have YBOCS > 23.
* YBOCS-SR went from 21.3 to 18 pre-post.
* Moderate credibility and expectancy for improvement.

Engagement pretty low in my opinion, as you would expect with a completely self-guided app:
> App utilization varied with 6.7% of participants reporting using the App on average several times per day, 33.3% reporting using the App several times per week, 26.7% reporting once per week utilization, 26.7% reporting using the App less than once per week, and 6.7% reporting no utilization.
