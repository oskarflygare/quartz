# My notes
- Even though they observe a lower rate of suicides in the contact group, these findings are very weak (*p* = 0.043).
	- 15 (3.9%) vs 21 (4.6%) suicides in the first five years
	- Rates of suicide were higher in the *treatment* group, e.g. patients who accepted psychiatric treatment post-discharge. 6.2% suicide rate in the first five years after discharge.
