## Example citation
The OCI-R has excellent psychometric properties with an internal consistency alpha for the total score of 0.83, and sub-scale alphas ranging from 0.83 to 0.92 [@abramowitz2006].

The OCI-R can accurately distinguish patients diagnosed with OCD from those with other anxiety disorders (AUC = 0.81), and the optimal cut-off for such a distinction is a score of 14 [@abramowitz2006].

### Key takeaways
* Internal consistency alpha = 0.83, subscale alphas from 0.83 to 0.92
* Correlation between OCI-R YBOCS score = 0.41
* OCI-R total score to distinguish between OCD and other anxiety disorders = AUC 0.81 (0.77 to 0.86).
* Cut-offs on the OCI-R versus diagnosis of OCD or other anxiety disorders, best cutoff was 14 (64% of OCD patients have above, 74% of other patients have below).
