Behavioral economics can be inform implementation efforts, for example by making the desired behavior default and other common nudging techniques [@beidas2021].

### Key takeaways
* Implementation science should use principles and concepts from behavioral economics

Implementation science comes from the realization that many scientific advances do not reach clinical practice and "real" patients. The focus is often on clinician behavior change *within organizational constraints*.

Behavioral economics has a lot to offer here, for example through various nudging techniques.

> Behavior economics approaches are best applied to behavioral barriers (ie, cognitiv or psychological processes that operate prior to or during decision-making, or behaviors that get in the way of achieving a target behavior) rather than structural barriers (eg, policy) that include external factors that may get in the way of an individual engaging in a specific behavior.
