> ...in the absence of demand, increasing the supply of mental health services does not reduce the treatment gap...

> Our findings indicate that across multiple low-resource settings... ...people fail to seek mental health services–and disengage from services–because people interpret their psychological and emotional states as reactions to social and economic problems, not as health conditions that can be addressed by medical services.

> Treating people and sending them back to the same conditions that made them sick is a Sisyphean task
