# Example citation

Network analysis can also be performed sequentially throughout treatment to investigate how the effects of treatment on symptom networks evolve and cascade over time [@blanken2019].

In a novel sequential analysis of symptom networks over time, Blanken and colleagues found that the effects of CBT-I on insomnia was driven by early improvements in specific sleep complaints (“early morning awakening” and “difficulty maintaining sleep”), to later have an effect on dissatisfaction with sleep [@blanken2019].


# Key takeaways
* Scripts available on Github: https://github.com/tfblanken/NIA
* Cross-disorder analyses can take symptom overlap into account.
* Data from an RCT, CBT for insomnia (n = 52) vs no treatment (n = 52)
* Insomnia rated on the ISI, depression on the PHQ-9. Weekly analyses of network structures
* “Sequential development of treatment-induced changes in individual symptoms” : which symptoms were the most affected by treatment and which were the least affected?

## Results

Insomnia symptoms were primarily affected, “early morning awakening” and “difficulty maintaining sleep”. “Dissatisfaction with sleep” improved later.

The authors argue that the effects of CBT-I on depressive symptoms is indirect, via effects on specific sleep problems.
