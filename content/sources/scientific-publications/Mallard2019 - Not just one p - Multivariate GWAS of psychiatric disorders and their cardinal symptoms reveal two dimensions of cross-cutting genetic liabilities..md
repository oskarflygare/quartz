-   UK Biobank
-   Psychosis, mania and irritability (Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Depression)
-   Genomic SEM to analyse underlying constructs     
-   Found **two** constructs: General vulnerability to self-reported symptoms and transdiagnostic vulnerability to clinically-diagnosed disease. They were modestly correlated (_r_ = .34)

> These findings inform criticisms of psychiatric nosology by suggesting that cross-disorder genetic liabilities identified in GWASs of clinician-defined psychiatric disease are relatively distinct from genetic liabilities operating on self-reported symptom variation in the general population.
