# Example citation

The high degree of co-occurrence between OCD and anorexia nervosa can in part be explained by shared genetic factors [@cederlof2015]

# Key takeaways
* National Patient Register. OCD (n = 19814) and AN (n = 8462)
* Females with OCD had OR = 16 for AN-diagnosis, for males it was higher at OR = 37.
* Relatives of patients with OCD had increased risk for AN, and the magnitude varied with genetic relatedness.
* Genetic overlap between (self-report) OCD and (diagnosed) AN, *r* = 0.52 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.81). **BUT** specific genetic influences more important.
