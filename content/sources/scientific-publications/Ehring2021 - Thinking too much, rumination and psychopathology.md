# Example citation


# Key takeaways
* Rumination is one form of repetitive negative thinking. The author argues that rumination shares the same process as excessive worry in [[GAD]], trauma-related rumination in PTSD and post-event processing in [[social anxiety disorder]].
* In cognitive theory, much attention is given to the _content_ of negative thoughts, but we should also focus on the _process_. Identifying thinking styles like rumination can help us understand psychopathology.
