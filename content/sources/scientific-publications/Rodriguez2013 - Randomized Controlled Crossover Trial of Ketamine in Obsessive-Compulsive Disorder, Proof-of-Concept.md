# Example citation
In one double-blind randomized controlled trial (n = 15), unmedicated participants with severe OCD received either ketamine or placebo. One week after the first infusion, 50% of participants receiving ketamine showed a treatment response, compared to none in the placebo group [@rodriguez2013].

# Key takeaways
* RCT, double-blind, n = 15 adult OCD patients with severe OCD.
* Y-BOCS used. 4 of 8 ,50%, of ketamine patients responded after one week. 0% response in placebo patients.
* Three main findings:
	* Participants receiving ketamine first showed significant rapid reduction in obsessions during the infusion that persisted until 1-week post-infusion compared with participants receiving placebo first.
	* Half of participants receiving ketamine first met treatment response criteria at 1-week post-infusion. 
	* There were significant carryover effects suggesting that ketamine’s effects on OCD symptoms last longer than previously reported.
