### Key takeaways
* somatic obsessions, checking compulsions, and repeating compulsions, were more common in OCD

---
 Like the paper [[McDougle1995 - A case-controlled study of repetitive thoughts and behavior in adults with autistic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder]], they used YBOCS checklist to investigate whether certain obsessions or compulsions were more or less common in ASD compared to OCD. They found that somatic obsessions, checking compulsions, and repeating compulsions, were more common in OCD.

The main difference compared to the McDougle paper is that the participants with ASD all had WISC IQ > 70 and were able to report symptoms themselves. They also checked that the ASD participants understood obsessions and compulsions before administering the YBOCS checklist.

        Patients with prominent obsessive^compulsive symptoms may benefit from standard treatments for OCD but controlled trials are needed to confirm this.
