# Key takeaways
* **What landmark analyses are trying to address:** In a naive analysis, response and nonresponse is compared regarding survival from the start of the study, but response status is not determined at baseline but during follow-up.
* Sources of bias: Timing of response, impossibility of identifying a response in patients with shorter follow-up, increasing probability of response with longer follow-up. *Response group classification is dependent on length of follow-up.*
* To remove these sources of bias: response after landmark time and deaths before landmark time are ignored.

> "In the landmark method, a fixed time after the initiation of therapy is selected as a landmark for conducting the analysis of survival by response. Only patients alive at the landmark time are included in the analysis, separated into 2 response categories according to whether they have responded up to that time, that is, the landmark method ignores all responses after the landmark time and all deaths before that time."

## Drawbacks of landmark analysis

- Dependence on choice of landmark
- Lack of randomization in forming of groups
