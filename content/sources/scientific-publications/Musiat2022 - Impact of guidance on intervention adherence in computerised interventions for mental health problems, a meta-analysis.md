# Example citation
A meta-analysis of 22 studies found that therapist-guidance increased the average amount of intervention completion (*g* = 0.29, 95% CI 0.18-0.40) in ICBT [@musiat2022]

# Key takeaways
* k = 22, n = 3946
* Depression, GAD, social anxiety and panic disorder most common therapy targets, CBT/ACT most common interventions.
* Full completion rates also improved: OR = 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93).
