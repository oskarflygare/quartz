### Key takeaways
* They wanted to see whether the characteristics of ASD, SCZ and OCD were overlapping in young adults. They found moderate correlations but conclude that the overlap is not large.

 ## Summary of paper
 
> The proportion of people with ASD who show some SPD or OCD traits at a diagnostic level is very small.

    Social and communicative deficits, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors are diagnostic features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The present study examinedthe relationship between autistic characteristics and schizophrenia-spectrum traits as well as between autistic characteristics and obsessive-compulsive traits in typically developed young adults.

    autistic characteristics and schizophrenia-spectrum traits had common social–emo- tional difficulties.

    Similarly, there was a moderate correlation between the AQ and PI total scores, which suggests that they had common problems in cognitive aspects; however, autism-spectrum and OCD traits differed with regard to other behavioral characteristics including repetitive or impulsive behaviors.

    As well as a lack of, or profound deficits in, social interactive skills, obsessional interests, and engaging in repetitive behaviorsarealso corefeatures of ASD.

    With regardto thelatter relationship,although both ASD and OCD have common features such as repetitive or stereotypic behaviors, there has been little research on this subject. However, two studies have reported the experiences of obsessions and compulsions in people with ASD and OCD (McDougle et al., 1995; McDougle, Kresch, & Posey, 2000; Russell, Mataix-Cols, Anson, & Murphy, 2005). Both studies found that, although there werealso some similarities, therewere certaindifferences betweenpeoplewith autism and thosewith OCD with regardto their obsessions and compulsions.

    Russell et al. (2005) compared the frequency and severity of repetitive ‘obsessional’ thoughts and compulsive behaviors in 40 high-functioning adults with ASD and 45 gender-matched adults with OCD. The severity and types of obsessive- compulsive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman, Price, Rasmussen, & Mazure, 1989) and its ancillary Symptom Checklist (Y-BOCS-SC), respectively. The results revealed a similar frequency of obsessions and compulsions across the two groups; however, the OCD group reported significantly higher frequencies of somatic obsessionsand repeating/checking compulsions.A discrimination analysis revealed that a single type of obsession, somatic, and a single type of compulsion, repeating, predicted group membership because both symptoms were more frequent in the OCD group than the ASD group. The number of reported symptoms showed that the OCD group had more obsessions and compulsions than the ASD group.
