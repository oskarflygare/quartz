# Example citation

[[Most psychological scales are only used once]]

# My notes
- Most scales are used only once, and even when they are used multiple times researchers often summarize scores in varying ways

> Psychology should be serious about standardising its measures – and currently is not.

> If we want to build a cumulative evidence base in psychology, we need to standardise our measures and protocols. Psychologists need to stop remixing and recycling, and start reusing (measures, not toothbrushes).

# Abstract
Most psychological measures are used only once or twice. This proliferation and variability threaten the credibility of research. The Standardisation Of BEhavior Research (SOBER) guidelines aim to ensure that psychological measures are standardised and, unlike toothbrushes, reused by others.
