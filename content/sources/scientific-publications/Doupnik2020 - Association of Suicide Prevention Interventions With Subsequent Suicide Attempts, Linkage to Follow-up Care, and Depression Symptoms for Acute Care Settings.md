[[Brief acute care suicide prevention interventions reduce the probability of subsequent suicide attempts]] 

# Key takeaways
* In this review they looked at "brief acute care suicide prevention interventions"
	* Most often a single face-to-face session, and sometimes telephone follow-up
* *k* = 14, *n* = 4270
* There were reductions in suicide attempts (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 - 0.89) and increased "linkage to follow-up" (I guess adherence) (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.79 - 5.17). No differences in depressive symptoms (*g* = 0.28, 95% CI -0.02 - 0.59)

**Conclusions:**
> Suicide prevention interventions delivered during and after a single in-person acute care encounter may be effective at reducing subsequent suicide attempts and improving patients’ odds of linkage to follow-up mental health care. Future efforts to implement brief suicide prevention interventions in acute care are likely to reduce patients’ risk of future suicide attempts and improve their continuity of mental health care.

Some studies used other techniques than safety planning. There was a mix but some emphasis on MI-techniques and problem solving skills.
