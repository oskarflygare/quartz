# My notes
- Follow-up data in [[motto2001]]
- Treatment compliance was defined as 1 month post-discharge adherence to trt.
- They repeat the importance of avoiding anything in terms of requesting information or action. 
> 	By so doing we hope to emphasize that our interest is simply and entirely to let the person know that we remain aware of his existence and maintain positive feelings toward him.

- The impact of one note is not expected to be high, but receiving many notes over time can have a big effect.

> The schedule for these contacts is monthly for 4 months, then every 2 months for 8 months, and finally every 3 months for 4 years – a total of 5 years and 24 contacts.
- They discuss that <90 days after discharge requires a more intensive form of support, this is not intended as acute care.
## Example letter

# Abstract
ABSTRACT: A program was developed to exert a suicide prevention influence on high-risk persons who decline to enter the health care system. There were 3,006 patients admitted to a psychiatric in-patient service because of a depressive or suicidal state who were contacted to determine if the post-discharge plan was followed. Half of those who refused their treatment program were contacted by telephone or letter on a set schedule. The contact was limited to expressing interest in the person's well-being. Mortality in the contact group was compared with the no-contact subjects and with the subjects who had accepted treatment, after 1, 2, 3, and 4 years. Suicidal deaths were found to diverge progressively in the three groups, the treatment subjects showing the highest rates, the no-contact group coming next, and the contact subjects showing the lowest. The observed divergence between the contact and no-contact groups provides tentative evidence that a high-risk population for suicide can be identified and that a systematic approach to reducing that risk can be applied.
