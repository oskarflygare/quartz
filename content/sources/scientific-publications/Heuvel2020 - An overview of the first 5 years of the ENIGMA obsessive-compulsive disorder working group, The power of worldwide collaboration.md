# Key takeaways
* The OCD group in ENIGMA currently has 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, total n = 2323
* Smaller hippocampus (*d* = -0.13), larger pallidum (*d* = 0.16). Medicated adult OCD patients have lower cortical thickness (*d*'s between -0.10 and -0.26)
* Disease chronicity has an impact on multiple brain measures, providing additional incentive to provide treatment.

> One example is the unexpected, but robust finding that medication status and disease chronicity both have a marked impact on all brain measures analyzed to date. This has two direct implications: First, it emphasizes the importance of establishing longitudinal studies to examine the beneficial and potential harmful effects of medication on the developing brain and; second, the fact that disease chronicity is related to marked morphological alterations of the brain might provide additional incentive to invest in the implementation of state-of-the-art interventions (e.g., exposure treatment requires significant scale up across the globe) and the development of innovative treatments for those who do not respond to first line interventions.
