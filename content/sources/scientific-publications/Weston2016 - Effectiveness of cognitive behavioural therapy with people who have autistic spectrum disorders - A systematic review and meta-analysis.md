    The aims of this study were to undertake a meta-analytic and systematic appraisal of the literature investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) when used with individuals who have autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) for either a) affective disorders, or b) the symptoms of ASDs.

    Following a systematic search, 48 studies were included. CBT, used for affective disorders, was associated with a non-signifi cant small to medium effect size, g = 0.24, for self-report measures, a signifi cant medium effect size, g = 0.66, for informant-report measures, and a signifi cant medium effect size, g = 0.73, for clinician-report measures.

    De fi nitive trials are needed to demonstrate that CBT is an empirically validated treatment for use with people who have ASDs.
