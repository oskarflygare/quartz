# Example citation

OCD has a bimodal onset, with early onset OCD (mean age 13) shows a more severe clinical presentation compared to late onset (mean age 25) of the disorder [@anholt2014].

# Key takeaways
* Admixture analysis was used to determine the best representation of the data distribution.
* n = 377
* Bimodal age of onset, best split was at 20 years old. Patients with early onset (≤19 years old) had more severe OCD and comorbid presentations.
* Early onset, mean = 12.82 (95% CI 11.18 to 14.46) years old
* Late onset, mean = 24.90 (95% CI 21.30 to 28.50) years old
