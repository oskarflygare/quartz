# Example citation


# Key takeaways
* Four broad factors: neurodevelopmenta, compulsive, psychotic, internalizing
* In [[Lee2019 - Genomic Relationships, Novel Loci, and Pleitropic Mechanisms across Eight Psychiatric Disorders]] they included MDD with SCZ/BIP as mood and psychotic disorders.
* Little added utility of a single dimension, [[p-factor]]

> Despite moderate-to-high genetic correlations across all 11 disorders, we find little utility of a single dimension of genetic risk across psychiatric disorders either at the level of biobehavioral correlates or at the level of individual variants.

* [[OCD]] and AN loads mostly on compulsive disorers category, but tic disorder has influence from neurodevelopmental disorders category too.

Bottom two panels include a *p-factor* but model was not improved compared to B panel.
