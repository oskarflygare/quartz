# The great replacement theory
Date created: 2022-05-18


A [[Conspiracy theories]] which claims that elites (and jews) in western countries "import" refugees and immigrants to reduce the proportion of whites.

Several mass shooters refer to this theory. Christchurch and Buffalo shooters for example. Tons of anti-Semitism and anti-black rhetoric. White supremacy.

There's a more mainstream version that is becoming more popular among American conservatives. Tucker Carlson tonight talks about changing demographics in terms of voters, benefiting democrats (obedient immigrants). The mostly viewers are predominantly white and older. He is shifting the [[Overton window]] by endorsing an extreme idea in a more polished form.
