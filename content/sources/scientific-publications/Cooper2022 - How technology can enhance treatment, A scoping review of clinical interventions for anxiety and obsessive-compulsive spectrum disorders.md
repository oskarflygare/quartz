# Key takeaways
* "Interventions that had integrated technology into clinical contexts to enhance treatment for anxiety and OC-spectrum disorders."
* *k* = 117
* Not a meta-analysis of ICBT per se but tech as supplement to F2F therapy
* For OCD: Half used videoconfering, *no* VR.

> First, what emerging innovations in treating anxiety and OC-spectrum disorders hold promise for clinical use? Second, what can researchers do to strengthen the evidence base for implementation?

## Their recommendations
1. Target a known problem in treatment. Focus on therapy processes rather than technology-for-disorder approach
2. How can tech be used to do *more* than act as a substitute for existing CBT components? For example, gamified skills practice, biofeedback
3. Report more than symptom change, like acceptability and cost
4. Use existing tech where possible
