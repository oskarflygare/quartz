## Why and when I was reading this
I was doing a deep dive into the nature of psychiatric disorders

### Key takeaways
* Insel was the director of NIMH and introduced the Research Domain Criteria RDoC framework, in an attempt to improve [[Construct validity]] in psychiatry.
* A goal was to be able to implement precision medicine also in psychiatry

# Notes & Comments

> These high morbidity and mortality figures speak to the potential for overall health gains if mental disorders can be more effectively diagnosed and treated. Could a "precision medicine" approach find traction here?

> But before research on the convergence of biology and behavior can deliver on the promise of precision medicine for mental disorders, the field must address the imprecise concepts that constrain both research and practice.

> RDoC asks researchers to shift from designing research projects narrowly built around current diagnostic categories to dimensions or systems, such as social processes or negative valence (responding to aversive objects or situations), which are supported by a deep cognitive and neural science and can be the basis for objective measures of psychopathology.
