# Example citation

In a large naturalistic sample (n = 3552), ERP delivered via video and supported by an app in between sessions resulted in large reductions on the dimensional Y-BOCS (*g* = 1.0 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.03]) [@feusner2022]

# Key takeaways
* Naturalistic sample from the nOCD app, n = 3552
* Three weeks of twice-weekly video sessions (รก 30 min), then 6 weeks of once-weekly video sessions. Average 10.6 therapist hours.
	* In between sessions they had text messaging support from therapist
	* They used app in between video sessions
* 43.4% reduction in OCD symptoms (Dimensional Y-BOCS *g* = 1.0 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.03])
* 63% response rate

Why have all this extra video support? I would have expected it to be mostly or only the nOCD app, but here it's just videotherapy with app in between.
