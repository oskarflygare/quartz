# Example citation
Gut microbiota alterations in psychiatric disorders are transdiagnostic rather than diagnosis-specific [@nikolova2021].

# Key takeaways
* Decrease in "microbial richnes" in psychiatric patients compared to control participants (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.02), but only bipolar disorder was consistent among the individual disorders.
* Transdiagnostic pattern of microbiota signatures rather than disorder specific patterns.
* This reminds me of the [[p-factor]] because there, as well, we see shared rather than disorder-specific patterns.

"This systematic review and meta-analysis found that gut microbiota perturbations were associated with a transdiagnostic pattern with a depletion of certain anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria and an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety.
