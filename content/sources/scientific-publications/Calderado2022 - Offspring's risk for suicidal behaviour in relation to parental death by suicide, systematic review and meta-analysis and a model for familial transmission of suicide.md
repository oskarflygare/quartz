# Example citation

The experience of losing a parent to suicide is a strong and independent risk factor for suicidal behaviour in offspring.

[[Losing a parent to suicide is a strong risk factor for suicidal behavior in children]]

# Key takeaways
* Twenty studies met our inclusion criteria.
* Offspring exposed to parental suicide were more likely to die by suicide (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 2.50–3.53) and attempt suicide (RR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.58–1.96) than offspring of two living parents. Furthermore, their risk of dying by or attempting suicide was significantly higher compared with offspring bereaved by other causes of death.
