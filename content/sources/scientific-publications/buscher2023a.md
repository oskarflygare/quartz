# My notes
- Combination of video sessions and online modules
- They developed 31(!) online modules
- They cite some treatment books in refs 34-37 regarding the importance of individually tailored treatment plans
- Three treatment phases. First phase is obligatory, then it's selected based on the case conceptualization.
	- "during the initial phase, the objectives include understanding the suicidal crisis, conducting a risk assessment, identifying reasons for living, and implementing crisis therapy strategies"
	- "Accordingly, the focus of the second treatment phase centers on addressing 1 or 2 core “suicidal drivers”, that is perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, hopelessness, entrapment, worthlessness, or unbearability"
	- "In the final phase, relapse prevention strategies (relapse prevention task and letter to the suicidal self) are implemented to prepare patients for potential future suicidal crises.


> The following module drafts were reviewed: means restriction, safety planning, reasons for living, hope box, motivational interviewing, narrative interview, chain analysis, cognitive model, dealing with perceived burdensomeness, enhancing self-esteem, and fostering social relationships.

To consider: fear of involuntary hospitalisation among patients. Should be clear *who* reads their messages and *why*:

> Data security and privacy should be ensured, and patients should be informed who reads their entries and how they will be used in therapy (eg, to prevent fear of involuntary hospital admission).

- Patients were positive to patient examples in the modules

# Abstract
Background: Digital formats have the potential to enhance accessibility to care for individuals with suicidal ideation. However, digital self-help interventions have faced limitations, including small effect sizes in reducing suicidal ideation, low adherence, and safety concerns.
Objective: Therefore, we aimed to develop a remote blended cognitive behavioral therapy intervention that specifically targets suicidal ideation by blending video therapy with web-based self-help modules. The objective of this paper is to describe the collaborative development process and the resulting intervention and treatment rationale.
Methods: First, we compiled intervention components from established treatment manuals designed for people with suicidal ideation or behavior, resulting in the development of 11 drafts of web-based modules. Second, we conducted a qualitative study, involving 5 licensed psychotherapists and 3 lay counselors specialized in individuals with suicidal ideation who reviewed these module drafts. Data were collected using the think-aloud method and semistructured interviews, and a qualitative content analysis was performed. The 4 a priori main categories of interest were blended care for individuals with suicidal ideation, contents of web-based modules, usability of modules, and layout. Subcategories emerged inductively from the interview transcripts. Finally, informed by previous treatment manuals and qualitative findings, we developed the remote blended treatment program.
Results: The participants suggested that therapists should thoroughly prepare the web-based therapy with patients to tailor the therapy to each individual’s needs. Participants emphasized that the web-based modules should explain concepts in a simple manner, convey empathy and validation, and include reminders for the safety plan. In addition, participants highlighted the need for a simple navigation and layout. Taking these recommendations into account, we developed a fully remote blended cognitive behavioral therapy intervention comprising 12 video therapy sessions and up to 31 web-based modules. The treatment involves collaboratively developing a personalized treatment plan to address individual suicidal drivers.
Conclusions: This remote treatment takes advantage of the high accessibility of digital formats while incorporating full sessions with a therapist. In a subsequent pilot trial, we will seek input from individuals with lived experience and therapists to test the feasibility of the treatment.
