# My notes
- Long-term follow-up for [[carter2005]]
- No between-group diff in repeat self-poisoning
	- postcards 24.9% (20.6 to 29.5)
	- control group 27.2% (22.8 to 31.8)
- Halving of bed days (IRR = 0.54).

# Abstract
BackgroundRepetition of hospital-treated self-poisoning and admission to
                           psychiatric hospital are both common in individuals who self-poison.AimsTo evaluate efficacy of postcard intervention after 5 years.MethodA randomised controlled trial of individuals who have self-poisoned:
                           postcard intervention (eight in 12 months) plus treatment as usual
                              v. treatment as usual. Our primary outcomes were
                           self-poisoning admissions and psychiatric admissions (proportions and
                           event rates).ResultsThere was no difference between groups for any repeat-episode
                           self-poisoning admission (intervention group: 24.9%, 95% CI 20.6-29.5;
                           control group: 27.2%, 95% CI 22.8-31.8) but there was a significant
                           reduction in event rates (incidence risk ratio (IRR)=0.54, 95% CI
                           0.37-0.81), saving 306 bed days. There was no difference for any
                           psychiatric admission (intervention group: 38.1%, 95% CI 33.1-43.2;
                           control group: 35.5%, 95% CI 30.8-40.5) but there was a significant
                           reduction in event rates (IRR=0.66, 95% CI 0.47-0.91), saving 2565 bed
                           days.ConclusionsA postcard intervention halved self-poisoning events and reduced
                           psychiatric admissions by a third after 5 years. Substantial savings
                           occurred in general hospital and psychiatric hospital bed days.
