# Example citation

[[Being alone, at home, and passive leisure correlated with increased suicidal ideation in patients recently discharged from inpatient care after a suicide attempt]]

# Key takeaways
* n = 42, individuals hospitalized for a suicide attempt
* 7 days EMA after hospital discharge
* Increase in suicidal ideation: being at home or at work
* Decrease in suicidal ideation: being in the home of close others, being in a festive or leisure environment
* They basically just made a huge regression with all the factors.
