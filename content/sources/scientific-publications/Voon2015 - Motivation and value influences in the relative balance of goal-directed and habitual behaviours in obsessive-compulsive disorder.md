## Why and when I was reading this
I was doing a deep dive into the role of [[Habits]] in [[OCD]]

### Key takeaways
* OCD subjects (compared to healthy controls) were less goal oriented and more habitual to reward outcomes, with a shift towards more goal orientation and lower habitual choices to loss outcomes.
* two
* three

> We show a critical influence of outcome valence on the relative balance of goal-directed and habitual learning in OCD. In the context of reward outcomes, OCD is characterized by impaired goal-directed learning along with a relative shift towards enhance habitual learning. For OCD patients (but not HVs), the pattern shift with goal-directed learning enhanced and habitual learning impaired, relative to the reward condition.

> We show that OCD is associated with a specific enhancement in habitual learning to reward outcomes and that this enhanced habitual learning correlates with greater YBOCS compulsivity severity scores.

        OCD subjects compared with healthy volunteers were less goal oriented (model-based) and more habitual (model-free) to reward outcomes with a shift towards greater model-based and lower habitual choices to loss outcomes. OCD subjects also had enhanced acquisition learning to loss outcomes on the one-step task, which correlated with goal-directed learning in the two-step task. OCD subjects had greater stay behaviours or perseveration in the one-step task irrespective of outcome. Compulsion severity was correlated with habitual learning in the reward condition. Obsession severity was correlated with greater switching after loss outcomes.
