# Example citation


# Key takeaways
* Stage models means taking a longitudinal perspective. How can we identify and prevent stage transitions in depression? Can CBT be used?
	* Not just symptom reduction but also being proactive
* [[Insomnia and rumination are key mechanisms propelling stage transitions in depression]], **trans-stage** meaning across all different stages!
	* They are particularly important treatment targets if this is true.
* They review the impact of insomnia on mood:
	* Stronger emotional reactions to negative stimuli
	* Impaired emotion regulation
	* More negative emotional memories
* Impact of rumination (Response Styles Theory by Nolen-Hoeksema)
	* Increases in mood-congruent thinking
	* Decreases in problem-solving and instrumental behavior
	* Decreases in social support
* [[Rumination is a trans-diagnostic style of thinking in psychopathology]]

> When applied to psychiatric disorders, stage models reflect the progression from prodromal symptoms to full episodes, to recurrent episodes of greater severity, and finally to treatment resistance.
