# Key takeaways
* Emotion regulation is relevant when we experience emotion in undesirable ways and want to down- or up-regulate our emotional response.
* Sometimes regulating the emotion is itself the goal ("I want to feel less sad") and sometimes there's another value we seek
* Intrinsic (your own emotions) vs extrinsic (someone elses emotions) emotion regulation
* Five "families" of emotion regulation strategies
	* Situation selection (common strategy in CBT therapies)
	* Situation modification, in the external environment
	* Attentional deployment (e.g., distraction)
	* Cognitive change (changing appraisal)
	* Response modulation (using alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, exercise, deep breathing, food to alter you emotions)
* Three steps of emotion regulation:
	* *Identifying* a relevant situation
	* *Selecting* a strategy
	* *Implementing* the chosen strategy
