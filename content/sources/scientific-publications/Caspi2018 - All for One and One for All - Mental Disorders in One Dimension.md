## Key takeaways
-   The three categories internalizing, externalizing, and thought disorder was an attempt to sort diagnoses into three overarching categories. Some problems:
        
-   Correlations were very high even across these domains
-   Longitudinal data showed that one diagnosis at time 1 predicted the same disorder, but also other disorders at later time points    
-   Heritability of psychiatric disorders is strong, but with very little specificity       
-   Importantly, **we don't know about the causal directions here.**
