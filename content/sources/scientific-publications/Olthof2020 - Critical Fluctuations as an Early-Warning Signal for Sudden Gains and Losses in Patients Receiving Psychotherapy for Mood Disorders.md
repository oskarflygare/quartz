# Example citation


# Key takeaways
* n = 328, 114 had sudden gain or loss (34.8%)
	* The clinical setting was intensive psychotherapy
* Daily ratings on the Therapy Process Questionnaire (TPQ)
	* Looks like a homegrown thing made by one of the senior authors. They have a few items on symptom severity that is more broad.
* Code: https://osf.io/4szhb
* Higher *dynamic complexity* predicted [[sudden gains]] and losses in a 4-day window. It was an [[early warning signal]].
	* Dynamic complexity was calculated on a per-item basis.
* How can we understand sudden gains/losses? If we think that psychopathology and psychotherapy are complex systems, they may have [[Tipping point]] which pushes the system from one state to another.

> Although sudden gains and losses are very different phenomena in a clinical sense, they are similar in the fact that they both represent order transitions, a universal change phenomenon that can be predicted with general EWSs.
