# Example citation
Potential environmental risk factors involve birth complications, pregnancy and the postpartum period, infection, and stressful life events [@brander2016].

Although birth complications, pregnancy and the postpartum period, infection, and stressful life events are potential environmental risk factors for OCD, the field is lacking prospectively collected data with twin-design to control for genetic or unmeasured environmental factors [@brander2016].

# Key takeaways
* Potential risk factors: birth complications, pregnancy and the postpartum period, infection, stressful life events
* Limited evidence: parental age, season of birth, socioeconomic status, parental rearing practices, traumatic brain injury, substance use, vitamin deficiency
* Limitations in studies:
	* Only 22% prospectively collected data, so high risk of recall bias. Only two studies used twin-design so risk factors can be confounded by genetic or unmeasured environmental factors.
	* Most studies used small samples of OCD patients from specialist clinics, who tend to have comorbidity and a long illness duration
	* Heterogeneity in definitions of the risk factors
