# Example citation

A recent study performed a similar sequential analysis using data from a large randomized controlled trial comparing CBT to supportive psychotherapy for body dysmorphic disorder [@bernstein2021], and concluded that CBT and supportive psychotherapy exerted beneficial effects through distinct mechanisms.

# Key takeaways
* Data from Wilhelm's large RCT on CBT versus SPT
* In CBT, cognitive effects first and behavioral effects second
* One results we might see from network analysis: CBT is effective through common factors rather than specific hypothesised model components
* Strong links between interference of thoughts (BDD-YBOCS item 2) and avoidance (item 12), as well as been items 1 and 6 (time spent on thoughts/behaviors).

"Interestingly, node size for control of thoughts (item 5), time engaged in thoughts (item 1), control of repetitive behaviors (item 10), and time engaged in repetitive behaviors (item 6) grow most robustly across treatment, particularly in the latter assessments, indicating that CBT was particularly efficacious for these symptoms relative to SPT."
