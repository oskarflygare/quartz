# Example citation

A systematic review on OCD symptoms during the COVID-19 estimated that 32% of OCD-patients experienced a worsening in symptoms in the early stages of the pandemic, however a large proportion of the patients included were from Italy during the early stages of the pandemic [@guzick2021].

Having contamination-related OCD prior to the COVID-19 pandemic predicted greater increases in symptom severity during the pandemic, however specific concerns about COVID-19 were rare (pooled incidence 16%) [@guzick2021].
