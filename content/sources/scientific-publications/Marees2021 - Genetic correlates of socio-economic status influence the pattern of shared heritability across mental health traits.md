There is large genetic overlap between mental disorders, but mental disorders are also correlated with socio-economic status (SES).

One limitation of genetic studies that do not have within-family control (like sibling designs we can use in Sweden) is that the genetic associations to different phenotypes can be inflated when there is confounding by population-level things like SES.

Since SES is also heritable, there might be a genetic overlap between mental disorders and SES.

So they found a very large reduction for ADHD, while bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are virtually the same. Small effect on OCD.
