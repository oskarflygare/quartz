# Example citation

A cut-off of  ≥17 has been suggested as the threshold for OCD caseness [@veale2016].

The reliable change score on the OCI-R is  ≥13 points [@veale2016].

# Key takeaways
* They compared the full OCI, OCI-R and "OCI-R Main" which means the highest subscale
* Cut-offs for caseness, reliable change, clinically significant change
* n = 63 mild to moderate OCD, n = 73 severe OCD
* Cut-off change score for achieving clinically significant improvement in the IAPT sample was >= 22, reliable change score was >= 13
* In the severe sample, clinically significant improvement was >= 24, reliable change score was >= 15.

Cut-off of >= 17 on the OCI-R for caseness.

"This is the first study to directly compare the OCI and OCI-R using the same dataset. Our conclusion is that there does not seem to be any extra benefit from using the OCI over the OCI-R for measuring outcome in a service evaluation such as IAPT. The OCI-R has a significant advantage over the OCI with 24 fewer items to complete. This may be especially important for those people with OCD who struggle to complete a questionnaire in the context of a service like IAPT where a weekly measure is requested with the standard data set."
