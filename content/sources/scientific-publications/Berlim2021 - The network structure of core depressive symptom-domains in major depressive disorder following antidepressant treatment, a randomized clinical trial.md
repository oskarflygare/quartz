# Example citation

In a network analysis of depressive symptoms following treatment with antidepressants, Berlim et al. (2021) found that the depressive symptom-networks became more densely connected and predictable as depressive severity decreased with treatment [@berlim2021].


# Key takeaways
* RCT of escitalopram or desvenlafaxine (n = 151)
* Network structure of nine core MDD nodes before and after trt
* Most central symptom at baseline: fatigue
* Most central post-treatment: depressed mood
* Appetite/weight-disturbance most peripheral at both pre and post
* The networks were significantly *more* connected at post-treatment than at baseline, in particular depressed mood and cognitive disturbance/suicidality (see figure)
* 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) rating scale

Central symptoms or network nodes can be treatment targets because when they are (in)activated they affect other symptoms in the network.

> Our main finding was that, over time and irrespective of the AD used, the MDD symptom-domains network became more densely connected and predictable while the overall depressive severity significantly decreased.
