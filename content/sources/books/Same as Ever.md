# Key takeaways
* I think it was a refreshing take to focus on the things that are consistent over time, and not just the *current* trends and what's new compared to society ten-fifteen years ago.
* The book was very easy to read because the writing was straightforward and often delivered in small and quotable nuggets. But on the other hand I fear that this style also made it less memorable. It was more like a series of blog posts than a typical "one big idea" non-fiction book.

> Predicting what the world will look like fifty years from now is impossible. But predicting that people will still respond to greed, fear, opportunity, exploitation, risk, uncertainty, tribal affiliations, and social persuasion in the same way is a bet I'd take.

> And the irony is that the more history I read, the more comfortable I became with the future. When you focus on what never changes, you stop trying to predict uncertain events and spend more time understanding timeless behavior. Hopefully this book nudged you down that path.

## Highlights
- I’ve learned an important trick: to develop foresight, you need to practice hindsight. —Jane McGonigal ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=117))
- Amazon founder Jeff Bezos once said that he’s often asked what’s going to change in the next ten years. “I almost never get the question: ‘What’s not going to change in the next ten years?’ ” he said. “And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two.” ([Location 152](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=152))
- That’s what this book is about: In a thousand parallel universes, what would be true in every single one? ([Location 170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=170))
- Predicting what the world will look like fifty years from now is impossible. But predicting that people will still respond to greed, fear, opportunity, exploitation, risk, uncertainty, tribal affiliations, and social persuasion in the same way is a bet I’d take. ([Location 326](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=326))
	- [[Rather than trying to understand the specifics of the future, we should look for the core human drivers that never change]]
- As financial advisor Carl Richards says, “Risk is what’s left over after you think you’ve thought of everything.” ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=365))
- I have asked economic historians to give me the name of someone who predicted the depression, and it comes up zero. That stuck with me. Here we are today, blessed with hindsight, knowing the crash after the Roaring Twenties was obvious and inevitable. But for those who lived through it—people for whom the 1930s was a yet-to-be-discovered future—it was anything but. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=382))
- The fact that you can’t see it coming is exactly what makes it risky. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=400))
- History knows three things: 1) what’s been photographed, 2) what someone wrote down or recorded, and 3) the words spoken by people whom historians and journalists wanted to interview and who agreed to be interviewed. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=417))
- ==One, think of risk the way the State of California thinks of earthquakes. It knows a major earthquake will happen. But it has no idea when, where, or of what magnitude. Emergency crews are prepared despite no specific forecast. Buildings are designed to withstand earthquakes that may not occur for a century or more.== ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=440))
	- [[Building robust buildings means considering future risks without knowing when and where earthquakes will happen]]
    - Note: Harm reduction in suicide research
- Two, realize that if you’re only preparing for the risks you can envision, you’ll be unprepared for the risks you can’t see every single time. So, in personal finance, the right amount of savings is when it feels like it’s a little too much. It should feel excessive; it should make you wince a little. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=447))
- ==Your happiness depends on your expectations more than anything else. So in a world that tends to get better for most people most of the time, an important life skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving. It’s also one of the hardest.== ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=476))
- People gauge their well-being relative to those around them, and luxuries become necessities in a remarkably short period of time when the people around you become better off. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=485))
- By the early 1980s, the postwar togetherness that dominated the 1950s and ’60s gave way to more stratified growth, where many people plodded along while a few grew exponentially wealthier. ==The glorious lifestyles of the few inflated the aspirations of the many.== ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=560))
- The core here is that people think they want an accurate view of the future, but what they really crave is certainty. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=778))
- With a large enough sample, any outrageous thing is apt to happen,” Mosteller said. That’s part of why the world seems so crazy, and why once-in-a-lifetime events seem to happen regularly. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=802))
- If next year there’s a 1 percent chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1 percent chance of a crippling depression, a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1 percent chance of political collapse, and on and on, then the odds that something bad will happen next year—or any year—are . . . not bad. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=820))
- The odds of a bad news story—a fraud, a corruption, a disaster—occurring in your local town at any given moment is low. When you expand your attention nationally, the odds increase. When they expand globally, the odds of something terrible happening in any given moment are 100 percent. ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=847))
	- [[Switching your news consumption from the local to the global means that catastrophic bad news are guaranteed]]
- There is too much information in the world for everyone to calmly sift through the data, looking for the most rational, most correct answer. People are busy and emotional, and a good story is always more powerful and persuasive than ice-cold statistics. ([Location 919](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=919))
- The influence of a good story drives you crazy if you assume the world is swayed by facts and objectivity—if you assume the best idea or the largest numbers or the correct answer wins. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=998))
- In a perfect world, the importance of information wouldn’t rely on its author’s eloquence. But we live in a world where people are bored, impatient, emotional, and need complicated things distilled into easy-to-grasp scenes. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1000))
- Some of the most important questions to ask yourself are: Who has the right answer, but I ignore because they’re inarticulate? And what do I believe is true but is actually just good marketing? ([Location 1053](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1053))
- Some of the most important forces in the world—particularly those regarding people’s personalities and mindsets—are nearly impossible to measure and impossible to predict. ([Location 1091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1091))
- The danger, one you see often in investing, is when people become too McNamara-like—so obsessed with data and so confident in their models that they leave no room for error or surprise. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1183))
    - Note: No room for our irrational side
- The first step toward accepting that some things don’t compute is realizing that the reason we have innovation and advancement is because we are fortunate to have people in this world whose minds work differently from ours. ([Location 1198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1198))
- Historian Dan Carlin wrote in his book The End Is Always Near: Pretty much nothing separates us from human beings in earlier eras than how much less disease affects us. . . . If we moderns lived for one year with the sort of death rates our pre-industrial age ancestors perpetually lived with, we’d be in societal shock. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1269))
- R==ecord rain in 2017 led to record vegetation growth that summer. It was called a superbloom, and it caused even desert towns to be covered in green. A dry 2018 meant all that vegetation died and became dry kindling. That led to some of the biggest wildfires California had ever seen. So record rain directly led to record fires.== ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1312))
- A proper state where things work well but break when you try to scale them to a different size or speed. It applies to so many things in life. ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1393))
- An important thing about this topic is that most great things in life—from love to careers to investing—gain their value from two things: patience and scarcity. Patience to let something grow, and scarcity to admire what it grows into. ([Location 1452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1452))
- Are militaries home to the greatest technical visionaries? The most talented engineers? Perhaps. But more importantly, they’re home to Really Big Problems That Need to Be Solved Right Now. Innovation is driven by incentives, which come in many forms. On one hand there’s “If I don’t figure this out I might get fired.” That will get your brain in gear. ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1527))
- Militaries are engines of innovation because they occasionally deal with problems so important—so urgent, so vital—that money and manpower are removed as obstacles, and those involved collaborate in ways that are hard to emulate during calm times. ([Location 1539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1539))
- “The trauma of the Great Depression did not slow down the American invention machine,” economist Robert Gordon wrote. “If anything, the pace of innovation picked up.” ([Location 1599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1599))
    - Note: A crisis forces you to find new solutions
- No one cheers for hardship—nor should they—but we should recognize that it’s the most potent fuel of problem-solving, serving as both the root of what we enjoy today and the seed of opportunity for what we’ll enjoy tomorrow. ([Location 1643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1643))
- Good news comes from compounding, which always takes time, but bad news comes from a loss in confidence or a catastrophic error that can occur in a blink of an eye. ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1649))
- On a similar note, author Yuval Noah Harari writes: “To enjoy peace, we need almost everyone to make good choices. By contrast, a poor choice by just one side can lead to war.” ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1707))
- The idea of “complex to make, simple to break” is everywhere. Construction requires skilled engineers; demolition requires only a sledgehammer. Even when something doesn’t break easily, the thing that could break it is usually simpler than whatever made it. ([Location 1709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1709))
	- [[Everything is complex to make and simple to break]]
    - Note: Creating something and criticizing it
- Most catastrophes come from a series of tiny risks—each of which is easy to ignore—that multiply and compound into something huge. The opposite is true: Most amazing things happen when something tiny and insignificant compounds into something extraordinary. ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1738))
- That’s the balance—planning like a pessimist and dreaming like an optimist. That mix is counterintuitive, but it’s so powerful when done right. ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1847))
- The trick in any field—from finance to careers to relationships—is being able to survive the short-run problems so you can stick around long enough to enjoy the long-term growth. Save like a pessimist and invest like an optimist. Plan like a pessimist and dream like an optimist. ([Location 1900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1900))
- Psychologist Amos Tversky once said that “the secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.” ([Location 1941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1941))
- But Tversky’s point is that if your job is to be creative and think through tough problems, then time spent wandering around a park or aimlessly lounging on a couch might be your most valuable hours. A little inefficiency is wonderful. ([Location 1944](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1944))
- The traditional eight-hour work schedule is great if your job is repetitive or physically constraining. But for the large and growing number of “thought jobs,” it might not be. You might be better off taking two hours in the morning to stay at home thinking about some big problem. Or go for a long midday walk to ponder why something isn’t working. ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=1972))
- That’s because writing good stuff isn’t a hack. It’s hard. It takes time and creativity. It can’t be manufactured. It works, with a near 100 percent success rate. But it is the social media equivalent of a heavy workout. ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2045))
    - Note: Compared to social media "hacks"
- Jeff Bezos once talked about the realities of loving your job: If you can get your work life to where you enjoy half of it, that is amazing. Very few people ever achieve that. Because the truth is, everything comes with overhead. That’s reality. Everything comes with pieces that you don’t like. ([Location 2070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2070))
- If you recognize that inefficiency—“bullshit,” as Pressfield puts it—is ubiquitous, then the question is not “How can I avoid all of it?” but “What is the optimal amount to put up with so I can still function in a messy and imperfect world?” ([Location 2095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2095))
- Volatility. People having bad days. Office politics. Difficult personalities. Bureaucracy. All of them are bad. But all have to be endured to some degree if you want to get anything done. ([Location 2109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2109))
	- [[Every job comes with drawbacks, focus on increasing the ratio of positives instead]]
- Most competitive advantages eventually die. ([Location 2128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2128))
- The idea that advantage has a shelf life is a fundamental part of growth. ([Location 2194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2194))
- Those kinds of ideas—counterintuitive, but ultimately true—are the ones worth paying most attention to, because they’re easiest to overlook. ([Location 2201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2201))
- Species are the same. Some happen to live a long time, but the odds of surviving don’t improve over time. Van Valen argued that’s the case mainly because competition isn’t like a football game that ends with a winner who can then take a break. Competition never stops. A species that gains an advantage over a competitor instantly incentivizes the competitor to improve. It’s an arms race. ([Location 2216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2216))
- “Keep running” just to stay in place is how evolution works. And isn’t this how most things in modern life work? Business? Products? Careers? Countries? Relationships? Yes to all of them. ([Location 2229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2229))
- Edison’s contribution was moderating the bulb’s brightness and longevity. That was an enormous breakthrough. But it was built on the back of dozens of previous breakthroughs, none of which seemed meaningful in their own right. ([Location 2275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2275))
- Author Safi Bahcall notes that Polaroid film was discovered when sick dogs that were fed quinine to treat parasites showed an unusual type of crystal in their urine. Those crystals turned out to be the best polarizers ever discovered. Who predicts that? Who sees that coming? Nobody. Absolutely nobody. ([Location 2293](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2293))
- When you realize that progress is made step-by-step, slowly over time, you realize that tiny little innovations that no one thinks much of are the seeds for what has the potential to compound into something great. ([Location 2310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2310))
- Everything is sales also means that everyone is trying to craft an image of who they are. The image helps them sell themselves to others. Some are more aggressive than others, but everyone plays the image game, even if only subconsciously. Since they’re crafting the image, it’s not a complete view. There’s a filter. Skills are advertised, flaws are hidden. ([Location 2344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2344))
    - Note: Musicians have to do this, but we all do it to some extent
- You didn’t know I stutter because I didn’t talk when I knew it would be difficult for me. You never know what struggles people are hiding. ([Location 2367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2367))
- Incentives are the most powerful force in the world and can get people to justify or defend almost anything. ([Location 2408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2408))
- “There was no way training could prepare a man for combat,” Ambrose wrote. It could teach you how to fire a gun and follow orders. But “it could not teach men how to lie helpless under a shower of shrapnel in a field crisscrossed by machine-gun fire.” No one could understand it until they experienced it. ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2524))
- The big takeaway here is that we really have no idea what policies we’ll be pushing for in, say, five or ten years. Unexpected hardship makes people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm. ([Location 2534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2534))
- Doing long-term thinking well requires identifying when you’re being patient versus just stubborn. Not an easy thing to do. The only solution is knowing the very few things in your industry that will never change and putting everything else in a bucket that’s in constant need of updating and adapting. The few (very few) things that never change are candidates for long-term thinking. Everything else has a shelf life. ([Location 2616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2616))
- Permanent information is harder to notice because it’s buried in books rather than blasted in headlines. But its benefit is huge. It’s not just that permanent information never expires, letting you accumulate it. It also compounds over time, leveraging off what you’ve already learned. ([Location 2640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2640))
    - Note: The value of a PKM increases with time
    - [[your information diet impacts your development]]
- The point, then, isn’t that you should read less news and more books. It’s that if you read good books you’ll have an easier time understanding what you should or shouldn’t pay attention to in the news. ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2647))
- It’s astounding, isn’t it? Here you have one of the top cancer researchers in the world, and he’s saying he could make a bigger impact on cancer if he focused on getting people to quit smoking—but that’s not intellectually stimulating enough for him. Or for many scientists, for that matter. ([Location 2670](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2670))
- But in most situations a handful of simple variables drives the majority of outcomes. If you’ve covered the few things that matter, you’re all set. A lot of what gets added after that is unnecessary filler that is either intellectually seductive, wastes your time, or is designed to confuse or impress you. ([Location 2687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2687))
	- What are the [[Core activities]] that drive value in my field?
- In most fields a handful of variables dictate the majority of outcomes. But paying attention to only those few variables can feel like you’re leaving too much of the outcome to fate. The more knobs you can fiddle with—the hundred-tab spreadsheet, or the Big Data analysis—the more control you feel you have over the situation, if only because the impression of knowledge increases. ([Location 2714](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2714))
- My theory is that length indicates the author has spent more time thinking about a topic than you have, which can be the only data point signaling they might have insights you don’t. It doesn’t mean their thinking is right. And you may understand their point after two chapters. ([Location 2729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2729))
    - Note: Ha! Chapters 3-16 are juat there to show effort
- An effective rule of thumb doesn’t bypass complexity; it wraps things you don’t understand into things you do. ([Location 2737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2737))
- An important component of human behavior is that people who’ve had different experiences than you will think differently than you do. They’ll have different goals, outlooks, wishes, and values. So most debates are not actual disagreements; they’re people with different experiences talking over each other. ([Location 2766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2766))
- Something fascinating then happened: The dogs seemingly forgot their learned behavior of drooling when the bell rang. Pavlov wrote about one dog eleven days after the floodwaters receded: After the application of the [bell] all the remaining conditioned reflexes almost completely disappeared, the animal again declined the food, became very restless and continuously stared at the door. ([Location 2803](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2803))
- People tend to have short memories. Most of the time they can forget about bad experiences and fail to heed lessons previously learned. But hard-core stress leaves a scar. ([Location 2813](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2813))
- The oldest story is that of two sides who don’t agree with each other. The question “Why don’t you agree with me?” can have infinite answers. Sometimes one side is selfish, or stupid, or blind, or uninformed. But usually a better question is, “What have you experienced that I haven’t that makes you believe what you do? And would I think about the world like you do if I experienced what you have?” ([Location 2846](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0C4B5D541&location=2846))
- And the irony is that the more history I read, the more comfortable I became with the future. When you focus on what never changes, you stop trying to predict uncertain events and spend more time understanding timeless behavior. Hopefully this book nudged you down that path.
