# Key takeaways
* The author managed to accomplish many things in the same book: it's about family, war, parenthood, love, integration, racism all at once. And still the book is relatively short!
* I particularly liked the way smells and flavours were key to the experience of home/away. The tea in Somalia and coffee in Sweden represented the countries.
* Once Nora was in Sweden she was constantly torn between her two world: making the best for her daughter in Sweden whilst also helping her family back home. Never being fully able to let go and move on because the memories and traumas were too strong.
