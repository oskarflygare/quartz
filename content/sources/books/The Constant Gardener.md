# Key takeaways
* Even though it is quite conspiratorial(?), the idea that big international companies may lean heavily on weak governments in developing countries to play down bad things is not far fetched. I liked the thriller and mystery!
* _"The most peaceble people will do the most terrible things when they're pushed.”_
* Could the Big Pharma storyline happen? Testing drugs in the African market before introducing them in the West, playing down side effects and ignoring suffering? Maybe. 
	* _"As my journey through the pharmaceutical jungle progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with the reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard.”_ John le Carre

- They had tested on pregnant rats and monkeys and rabbits and dogs, and had no problems. When they got to humans – all right, there were problems, but there always are. That’s the grey area the drug companies exploit. It’s at the mercy of statistics and statistics prove anything you want them to prove.
