I had just finished [[Gentlemen]] and wanted to continue with the series because I was hooked.

### Key takeaways
* I think the book lost a lot of tempo when it was all about looking back, and not that much happening in the *now*. Even though some things happened (they thought Conny's daughter had been abducted), this was always in the context of remembering the past.
