# Key takeaways
- Early [[plasticity]], late rigidity in relationships, just as in many other things in life:

> While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.

- I sometimes slander people who sign petitions or re-share some campaign on social media (or updating their profile picture with some symbol). To me it has felt like virtue signalling with no real-world impact. But this quote really made me reflect:

> I can’t help thinking about the editor in Prague who organized the petition for the amnesty of political prisoners. He knew perfectly well that his petition would not help the prisoners. His true goal was not to free the prisoners; it was to show that people without fear still exist. ([Location 3445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=3445))

## Highlights
- Einmal ist keinmal, says Tomas to himself. What happens but once, says the German adage, might as well not have happened at all. If we have only one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=203))
- Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman). ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=291))
- ==While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.== ([Location 1168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=1168))
- Once he had reached the lowest rung on the ladder, they would no longer be able to publish a statement in his name, for the simple reason that no one would accept it as genuine. Humiliating public statements are associated exclusively with the signatories’ rise, not fall. ([Location 2466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=2466))
- Insofar as it is possible to divide people into categories, the surest criterion is the deep-seated desires that orient them to one or another lifelong activity. Every Frenchman is different. But all actors the world over are similar—in Paris, Prague, or the back of beyond. ([Location 2479](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=2479))
- ==And again he thought the thought we already know: Human life occurs only once, and the reason we cannot determine which of our decisions are good and which bad is that in a given situation we can make only one decision; we are not granted a second, third, or fourth life in which to compare various decisions.== ([Location 2890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=2890))
- ==I can’t help thinking about the editor in Prague who organized the petition for the amnesty of political prisoners. He knew perfectly well that his petition would not help the prisoners. His true goal was not to free the prisoners; it was to show that people without fear still exist.== ([Location 3445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=3445))
    - Note: Not just for show, an important signal to others.
- Before we are forgotten, we will be turned into kitsch. Kitsch is the stopover between being and oblivion. ([Location 3572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YL9638&location=3572))
    - Note: A cleaned up story without the nuances
