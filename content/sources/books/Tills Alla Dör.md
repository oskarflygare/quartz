# Key takeaways
* Family members can become targets for revenge themselves, so they are extremely scared to talk to the police.
* The Ozzy and Maslah killings that started the entire thing were due to such a trivial issue (credit for a bank robbery), but it then spiraled into the rivalry between Shottaz and DÃ¶dspatrullen
* The Encrochat breakthrough by French police looks like a big reason most of these cases could be tried at all. I think almost all of the cases would still be unsolved otherwise.
* Some children in Rinkeby don't expect to live past 25 so they act accordingly. It's either die with honor or not, because you'll be dead before 30 anyway.
