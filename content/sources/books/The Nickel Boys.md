- It's gruesome to see how, even after formal laws prohibited slavery and other racist acts, the culture in the american south was still the same. The boys in the Nickel facilities were used as free labour for wealthy whites.
- The book is fiction but there was one of these facilities where they found buried skeletons in Florida.
