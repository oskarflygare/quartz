* Rating: 2/5

# Key takeaways
* I liked the scenery, reading about Nov-Dec events in late November was cozy with all the snow and Christmas preparations.
* The murder narrative was pretty straightforward and nicely paced
* What was a big minus for me, though, was that I really didn't understand the motive. Why was the murderer the way they were? We are left with no explanation and I lost interest.
* There were also some relationships between the different characters that probably go back to previous books that I haven't read. The story about the journalist wasn't connected to the murder story at all, it just felt out of place. But maybe this is because I haven't read the full series.
