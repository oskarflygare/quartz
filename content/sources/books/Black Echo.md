# Key takeaways

It was nice to actually have some faces to the different characters. The TV-series starts after these events so the book is kind of a prequel. But I liked the setup more than I had anticipated!

Yes, the book has tons of clich√©s but what do you expect from a police novel published 30 years ago. I enjoyed it for being good entertainment even though there were no life-changing insights.
