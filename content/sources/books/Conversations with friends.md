title: Conversations with friends

* Rating: 3/5

# Key takeaways
* As always with Rooney, I am extremely frustrated with the characters. Everyone's so stuck in their own head and their own anxiety that they become self-absorbed and not very empathetic. Shame and anxiety really turns you inward.
* The two young girls were thrown into this adult and complex relationship when they should just have had the opportunity to mess around at college and come to grips with their own sexuality, their own personalities.
* Just as in [[Normal People]], the main character seems unable to resist hurting the very person they long after, as if they have no other ways to express their strong feelings except being destructive.
