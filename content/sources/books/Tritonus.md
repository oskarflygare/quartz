# Key takeaways
* All the references to music were deeply enjoyable, perfect for someone with my interest.
* I enjoyed the sensitive description of the tip-toe male friendship that evolved over time between Brander and his neighbor. It's more what is between the words than what was explicitly said (as always). These men really struggled to connect and be vulnerable in front of each other, but this very struggle makes them look vulnerable instead.
* The description of how everyone in the community rallied to try to steer the young man away from hard-right ideas was well done, it seemed realistic to me.
