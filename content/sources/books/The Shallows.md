# Key takeaways
* *Information overload* has been an issue since the printing press, but the attention economy of the 21st century amps it up to max.
	* One way to cope is to increase scanning and skimming instead of deep reading.
* Interesting early publication of using computers for therapy:
	- Colby, K. M., Watt, J. B., & Gilbert, J. P. (1966). A computer method of psychotherapy: Preliminary communication. _The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease_, _142_(2), 148–152. [https://doi.org/10.1097/00005053-196602000-00005](https://doi.org/10.1097/00005053-196602000-00005)
	- Already with the first computer programs that could print written responses according to relatively simple formulas, people felt comfortable disclosing private things and felt a bond. It was simple validation and repeating in a purely supportive therapy manner.
- I think the book was well researched and I like that it didn't end up being a self-help book in the end, he stayed with the *one big idea* style consistently. 

> “In the world of 2001 people have become so machine like that the most human character turns out to be a machine. That is the essence of Kubrick’s dark prophecy. As we come to rely on computers to mediate our understanding of our world, it is our own intelligence that flattens into artificial intelligence.”

# How we read differently online compared to books

* When we go from reading a linear book to a non-linear webpage filled with hyperlinks and ads, we read in a different and more fragmented way.
- [[Reading online is F-shaped instead of linear]]
- This applies to digital gardens like this one. If the text on the page is peppered with hyperlinks, the reading of the actual text is hampered:

> But the inevitability of turning the pages of books into online inges should not prevent us from considering the side effects. To make a book discoverable and searchable online is also to dismember it. The cohesion of its text, the linearity of its argument or narrative as it flows through scores of pages, is sacrificed. What that ancient Roman craftsman wove together when he created the first codex is unstitched. The quiet that was "part of the meaning" of the codex is sacrificed as well. Surrounding every page or snippet of text on Google Book Search is a welter of links, tools, tabs, and ads, each eagerly angling for a share of the reader's fragmented attention.

Strip-mining versus slow excavation!

> The irony in Google's effort to bring greater efficiency to read. ing is that it undermines the very different kind of efficiency that the technology of the book brought to reading and to our minds-in the first place. By freeing us from the struggle of decoding text, the form that writing came to take on a page of parchment or paper enabled us to become deep readers, to turn our attention, and our brain power, to the interpretation of meaning. With writing on the screen, we're still able to decode text quickly—we read, if anything, faster than ever—but we're no longer guided toward a deep, personally constructed understanding of the text's connotations. Instead, we're hurried off toward another bit of related information, and then another, and another. **The strip-mining of "relevant content" replaces the slow excavation of meaning.**

People like Cal Newport therefore suggest time spent without novel stimuli, to practice this mindful attention of the world and our own thoughts. Doing chores without listening to or watching something, taking walks without listening to something etc. 

> The development of a well-rounded mind requires both an ability to find and quickly parse a wide range of information and a capacity for open-ended reflection. There needs to be time for efficient data collection and time for inefficient contemplation, time to operate the machine and time to sit idly in the garden. We need to work in Google's "world of numbers," but we also need to be able to retreat to Sleepy hollow. The problem today is that we're losing our ability to strike a balance between those two very different states of mind.
