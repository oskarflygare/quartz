## Highlights
- It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write. ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=83))
- So if you're paralyzed with fear, it's a good sign. It shows you what you have to do. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=356))
- The professional concentrates on the work and allows rewards to come or not come, whatever they like. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=364))
- We show up every day. We might do it only because we have to, to keep from getting fired. But we do it. We show up every day. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=516))
- We show up no matter what. In sickness and in health, come hell or high water, we stagger in to the factory. We might do it only so as not to let down our co-workers, or for other, less noble reasons. But we do it. We show up no matter what.

- Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because he is overly invested in its success and overterrified of its failure. The amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him. ([Location 528](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=528))
- The professional conducts his business in the real world. Adversity, injustice, bad hops and rotten calls, even good breaks and lucky bounces all comprise the ground over which the campaign must be waged. The field is level, the professional understands, only in heaven. ([Location 611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007A4SDCG&location=611))
- The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique not because he believes technique is a substitute for inspiration but because he wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come.
