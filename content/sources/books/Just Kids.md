# Key takeaways
* The best parts were when she described their work together and the process, she could paint that picture with just a few words. Also the loving portrait of this man who seemed to not always treat her well, but she could see the bigger picture and understood his reasons.
* I didn't follow all the name-drops but I guess for people who know it's contributing to the scenery.
* It's a very *poetic* book so things are not necessarily spelled out. For me this was a mixed bag, but when I enjoyed the reading I really enjoyed it!
