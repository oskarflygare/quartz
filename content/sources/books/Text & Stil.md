## 4 - Börja rätt

The beginning of a non-fiction text needs to do three things:

a) Give the text energy with something notable, a [[hook]] (an exciting event, unknown facts, conflict)
b) *Show* why the text is important. [[Show, don't tell]]
c) Make the reader feel secure

[[Why am I the right person to tell this story]]

Signposting lowers the tempo and wastes reader energy

[[Researchers tend to ask many questions at the beginning of a text]]

## 7 - Pitcha text

- Too few academics engage with popular press
- It's critical to find a "hook" to your text. Something relevant that has happened to which your text relates. Connect it to something bigger than just your research area.
	- Give direct quotes, define *current affairs* with examples.
- Your pitch to an editor should be extremely short. Five sentences or less about your subject and why they should publish your text *now*. Poignant facts give weight to your text.
- The editor should also become interested in your research, why *me*.
	- Present the thing in the first paragraph, link to yourself in the second.
	- Clear connection between the hook, your research, and your pitch
- Display *contrast* between the intellectual quality of your work (high) and your tendency to use complex prose when writing about it (low).
