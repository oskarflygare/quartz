# Key takeaways
* I appreciated the diary-like narration style where the author revealed her most intimate (and sometimes ugly) thoughts.
* At the same time, this is the main thing that I had an issue with when reading the book. It felt like too much introspection at times, and too little narrative development.
* It's easy to sympathise with the main character's awkward interactions with almost everyone she meets. There's a nakedness and forthrightness that is very relatable, and the main character showed some real vulnerability throughout the book.
