# Key takeaways
- Some problems from computer science can be effectively applied to other situations
	- The 37% rule from [[Optimal stopping]]
	- [[Least Recently Used is a useful rule of thumb for caches]]
- Some problems are naturally **hard** and don't have straightforward solutions, for example many [[Scheduling]] situations.
- Strive for [[Computational kindness]], i.e. reducing the computational burden on others

> Knowing that you are using an optimal algorithm should be a relief even if you don't get the results you were looking for.
