# Example citation
The authors argue that articles from individual research groups should be regarded as preliminary, **by default**. One single lab simply does not have the resources to vary all methodological aspects to check the robustness of results.

# Key takeaways
* Better protocols and methods sections are necessary but not sufficient for reproducibility. 
* They think it might not be worthwhile to specify every single way in which the methods can vary, there's just a massive amount of work to be done

Some proposed solutions:
- Large-scale collaborative projects such as psych genetics or Many Labs Project, Psychological Science Accelerator.
- Institutions for large-scale confirmatory studies because individual researchers don't have the resources needed to coordinate such initiatives
- Separate exploratory from confirmatory research
