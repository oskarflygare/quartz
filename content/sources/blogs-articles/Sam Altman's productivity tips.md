* Pick the right thing to work on, ask yourself [[The Hamming question]]
* Don't be afraid to learn new things, you'll be surprised at how fast you can get better
* Find a balance between working on your important projects and leaving room for chance encounters; even if 90% of them are a waste of time the other 10% will make up for it
* "The right goal is to allocate your year optimally, not your day". This is something Cal Newport mentions in his podcast a lot, in relation to [[Deep work]]
* He overcommits a little bit with projects to make himself more efficient and helps in avoiding distractions.  Perhaps to avoid [[Parkinson's Law]]
