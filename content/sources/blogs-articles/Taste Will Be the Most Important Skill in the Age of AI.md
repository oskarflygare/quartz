## Highlights
- Your capacity to judge the quality of your work increases faster than your capacity to produce quality work. Someone who decides to be a writer tends to be someone who reads a lot of great books. This develops your taste, and then when you write your own book, it will not initially meet your quality bar. You can only bridge the "taste gap" by doing the work and improving your skill.

- Developing your Taste is a good course of action to futureproof your career. Independent of where technology goes, having good taste will put you on the path of creating great work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwvgpjxtzsh9yqcakyr33c90))
