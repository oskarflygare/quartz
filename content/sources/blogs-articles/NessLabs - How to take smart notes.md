# Key takeaways
- [[Design your notes to have value long-term]]

## Highlights
- be very selective with quotes, which can sometimes hide our lack of understanding of a text.
- Permanent notes. Once a day (ideally), go through the notes you created in the first two steps, and turn them into permanent notes.
    - Note: More frequent than what I currently do
- Make sure to write your notes in a way your future self will understand. If you go back to old notes and don’t understand what exactly you were thinking—the exact thought process and context—when you wrote it down, this note-taking system won’t work as intended.
