# Key takeaways
- [[If we view the internet as a garden instead of a stream, we build and develop instead of argue and present]]

---

## Highlights
- In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.

- The stream is what I do on Twitter and blogging platforms. I take a fact and project it out as another brick in an argument or narrative or persona that I build over time, and recapitulate instead of iterate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha75096ygetmb1v2gvrr6vew))
- More than that, there’s a substance to the vision that you can’t help but long for reading it. Note that connections here aren’t banter, but the construction of a mental model of a subject area. And that model can be taken by someone else and extended, built on. Humanity can advance, not through argument by through a true collaboration.
  It really is the ultimate garden. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha7577zgdpqs2r6mghw80tvx))
    - Note: A sort of all-encompassing Wikipedia
- The “conversational web”. A web obsessed with arguing points. A web seen as a tool for self-expression rather than a tool for thought. A web where you weld information and data into your arguments so that it can never be repurposed against you. The web not as a reconfigurable model of understanding but of sealed shut presentations.
