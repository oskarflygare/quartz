Note-taking is the foundation of any PKM system, but in order to be helpful the system also needs to be structured so that the information can be applied for different needs.

PKM is three main activities:
1. Capturing and recording information
2. Management of that info (classify, summarize, synthesize...)
3. Using the information: output, creation, sharing

He then goes on to discuss *why* one should have a PKM system, as well as different strategies (physical [[Zettelkasten]] vs software like Obsidian). It felt a bit superfluous to me since I've already started in this space.
