## Why and when I was reading this
I am learning more about [[note-taking]] and [[Personal Knowledge Management]]

### Key takeaways
* His use of links and maps of content enabled him to produce more of his own thoughts, rather than just collecting
* He started of using [[Zettelkasten]] but has now created his own flavour of PKM

The trap of powerful collect tools like [[Evernote]] is that you can amass a lot of content by other people, but it doesn't extend your own thinking. This diminishes the [[Signal versus noise]] ratio and just becomes a pile of stuff over time, not really adding value: the [[Collector's fallacy]]. Nick used the linking of notes to create [[Map of Content|MoC]] for several topics he needed in his work as an editor.
