# Key takeaways
* "To give everyone a loud speaker is to assure that no on can be heard"
* With social media, everyone's voice can be heard. But who is listening?
* "It is not so much the other man's words as his silences which we have to learn in order to understand him"
* Many profound experiences puts us at a loss for words, so in those situations we "exist" by just being present and not speaking. But if speech is the only medium I might reach for explanations and solutions too early.
