# Key takeaways
- [[Increasing focus in your work means choosing what not to do]]

## Highlights
- Our companies ran at higher velocity, with higher standards and a narrower focus than most. Going faster, maintaining higher standards and with a narrower aperture. Sounds simple? The question is how you go about amping up your organization. How *much* faster do you run? How *much* higher are your standards? How hard do you focus? It is a performance ‘triad’ because they amplify each other. The compound effect can be electrifying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1pyhwqych58qex2fe61bmq))
    - Note: What are our metrics of velocity, standards and focus within academia?
- I rarely encountered a team that employed too narrow an aperture. It goes against our human grain. People like to boil oceans. Just knowing that can be to your advantage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1qgbxsqxp93xhnkvbv27ga))
- Focus is hard once you understand what that means. What are you not going to do? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1z1v3g1g6cwcnd8hjh10dh))
    - Note: Essentialism, saying no to good opportunities to focus on the few great ones.
