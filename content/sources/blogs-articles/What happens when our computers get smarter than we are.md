# Example citation


# Key takeaways
* Because the differences between us and apes are due to small genetic alterations over time, yet have had enormous consequences for the way our two species live and thrive, it is possible to think that similarly small changes from now on can have a profound impact.
* Once we arrive at [[machine superintelligence]] it's likely that machine intelligence will take off rapidly.
* *Once there is superintelligence, the fate of humanity is decided by the superintelligence*
* We are at the mercy of this superintelligence, what is its preferences? Reminds me of the paper-clip essay on waitbutwhy. You better make sure that the algorithm optimizes for everything we care about.
