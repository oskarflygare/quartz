# Key takeaways
* A key insight for me is that the postdoc is supposed to be the *start* of your path towards independence. It's ok to not be fully independent just yet
* The things I need to practice still are:
	* Writing grant proposals
	* Interacting with the wider scientific community (collaborations etc)
	* Leadership, taking on students

# Take ownership of your project
Be proud that you are the one that knows the most about this project. Ask for help, nobody expects you to know everything as a post-doc.

# Read broadly and learn more about research
It's time to *start* the transition to your independent career. This was comforting to read because I have the sense right now that I should already be in that transition, but I guess I am running too far ahead.

# Learn how to train people
You are not doing research in isolation, so practice leadership skills! Take on undergraduate students, take courses in mentoring and teaching.

# Practice writing papers and giving talks
I think I have these covered mostly, sounds like PhD students in the US are less independent than we are here.

# Position yourself to get good letters of reference
This typically means networking with collaborators and interacting with other faculty than your supervisors.

# Learn organisational skills
General productivity

# Be a good citizen of the lab and the department
Be nice to others and help out, this will help you as you become more senior.

# Network
What scientific community do you want to be in? Try to get to know that community, interact with their members.

# Learn how to write grants and apply for your own funding
Help your PI writing grants to learn the craft.

Ask to see successful applications from colleagues.

# Finish papers before you leave your postdoc
> Finish everything!

I guess the main point is that if you go to another place after your postdoc, you'll be busy over there and finishing your paper is way less likely.
