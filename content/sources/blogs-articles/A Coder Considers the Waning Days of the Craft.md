# Key takeaways
- [[AI is completely changing the way we write software, because producing code that runs is no longer a bottleneck]]

## Highlights
- By now, most people have had experiences with A.I. Not everyone has been impressed. Ben recently said, “I didn’t start really respecting it until I started having it write code for me.” I suspect that non-programmers who are skeptical by nature, and who have seen ChatGPT turn out wooden prose or bogus facts, are still underestimating what’s happening.

    - Note: seems like it's much better at writing code than prose
- What I learned was that programming is not really about knowledge or skill but simply about patience, or maybe obsession. Programmers are people who can endure an endless parade of tedious obstacles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcw3pr3pj8nzsk477xq6bv0))
- But A.I., as it was being described, seemed different. It provided a lot of help. I worried that it would rob me of both the joy of working on puzzles and the satisfaction of being the one who solved them. I could be infinitely productive, and all I’d have to show for it would be the products themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcwct8crc38r12kvvd0gcd1))
    - Note: This is a danger with using AI for writing as well. Something is lost if you don't struggle to generate the text yourself. Writing is thinking.
- But taking a bird’s-eye view of what happened that day? A table got a new header. It’s hard to imagine anything more mundane. For me, the pleasure was entirely in the process, not the product. And what would become of the process if it required nothing more than a three-minute ChatGPT session? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcwf4t962h7bn6160hxpm8p))
- When I got into programming, it was because computers felt like a form of magic. The machine gave you powers but required you to study its arcane secrets—to learn a spell language. This took a particular cast of mind. I felt selected. I devoted myself to tedium, to careful thinking, and to the accumulation of obscure knowledge. Then, one day, it became possible to achieve many of the same ends without the thinking and without the knowledge. Looked at in a certain light, this can make quite a lot of one’s working life seem like a waste of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcwrgh6bafpah9cmd2pb5ga))
- As software gets easier to make, it’ll proliferate; programmers will be tasked with its design, its configuration, and its maintenance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcwsst3zdrq2c41h03a6vzn))
    - Note: Same with text generation. That's not the bottleneck anymore.
- Programming by typing C++ or Python yourself might eventually seem as ridiculous as issuing instructions in binary onto a punch card. Dijkstra would be appalled, but getting computers to do precisely what you want might become a matter of asking politely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfcwvbkcavqv52gsk7d1f693))
