If we don't stop to reflect about our values and activities every now and then, we'll just continue with whatever we are doing due to [[Inertia]] and not realize we are chasing outdated dreams.

Julian Shapiro used a process to start with core values and then work downwards from there. He found [[Regret minimisation]] helpful too, imagining which choices would minimise regret once he's 80 and looking back at life.

For me, what if I don't pursue academia but instead go into data science or some other role? This will likely be something I regret. I like doing research, I like teaching, I like outreach.

[[Don't let money be a detour to achieving other values]]
