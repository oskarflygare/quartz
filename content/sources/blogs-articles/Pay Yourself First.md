## Why and when I was reading this


### Key takeaways
* David Bach's advice on personal finance (pay yourself first) means putting away savings *before* paying other things.
* The author generalizes this to work in general, adding a few "non-negotiables" at the start of their day: brewing nice coffee and going for a walk with their dog
* Seems similar to [[Deep work]] in that you don't check input stuff first thing but rather do important things.
