# Key takeaways
- DSM has expanded over the years, and now 50% of all Americans have at some point in their lives had a mental disorder (Kessler epidemiology).
- Have we actually discovered more conditions “in nature” or are we simply sub-typing and expanding into everyday life? Blurring the boundary between distress and disorder?
- An advantage of the current system with specific diagnostic criteria is improved [[Reliability]] of diagnosis, and a [[Lingua Franca]] despite theoretical differences between clinicians.
- Social constructivism critique: disorders are affected by clinicians themselves. Also mentioned in [[Why we need to get better at critiquing psychiatric diagnosis]]:

![[Why we need to get better at critiquing psychiatric diagnosis#Psychiatric diagnoses are not valid because they are decided by a committee]]

## Network approach to psychopathology

- Symptoms tend to cluster, why?
- Medical model: they co-occur because of a shared underlying cause, e.g. a latent disorder or brain aberration
- [[Axiom of local independence]] not fulfilled, symptoms are causally connected
- 

> The episode with a mental disorder represents the activation of causally linked symptom networks
