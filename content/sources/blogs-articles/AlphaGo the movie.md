# AlphaGo strategy
Date created: 2021-09-10

It only played to win, and didn't care about the margin. This confused many humans who watched the games because alphago appeared to pay weak moves when it was ahead.

The AI won the first three games against Lee Sedol, then he managed to find a strategy to beat the AI but lost the fifth, 4-1 to AlphaGo.

Because AlphaGo used novel strategies, and there was no human face to read for expressions of frustration or excitement, it made Lee Sedol question his own gameplay and use different strategies from what he normally would have used.
