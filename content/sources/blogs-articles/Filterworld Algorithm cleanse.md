## Highlights
- My iPhone became instantly more boring.
- I’m blissfully unaware of just how many people are vacationing at Lake Como this weekend.
- Call it an algorithm cleanse or an algorithm detox — I wanted to see what my digital life would be like without those familiar, addictive feeds. It also felt like a detox: For the first few days, I was extremely cranky as my brain grasped for the missing stimulus of content bombardment, the thousands of tiny fragments of thought that I exposed myself to in every spare moment. I was experiencing content withdrawal.
- It hasn’t been that long, but I’ve noticed some salutary effects. I don’t reach for my phone as quickly in moments of downtime (or while walking up stairs lol) and I’m much more likely to pick up a book and read a few pages.
- that most online media today isn’t actually designed to function without the added pillar of algorithmic feeds funneling content around to target audiences.
