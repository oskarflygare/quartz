# Key takeaways
* The pre-print is [[Kapoor2022 - Leakage and the Reproducbility Crisis in ML-based Science]]
* People usually apply ML-models after only a few hours of self-study, and reviewers don't have time to scrutinize the code.
* Risk of over-optimism related to ML models
* Hype around AI and inadequate *checks and balances*
* Most important issue: [[Data leakage]]
