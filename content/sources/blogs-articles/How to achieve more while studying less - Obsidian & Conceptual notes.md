# How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual notes
Date created: 2021-09-18

When you take in new information, focus on *concepts*. Create notes for new concepts, and expand old notes for concepts if you already have a note.

Typically when we study courses sequentially, we don't leverage old notes and concepts but just put them in separate folders. If we instead focus on the concepts we can lean on the old knowledge when we learn new things, and also realize that they might be not that new at all but rather just a variation on some other concept. The concept notes should be [[atomic note]] so that you can link them together: [[The value of a linked database of notes builds up over time]].

Equally important is what you *dont* need. Basic facts, to-do's, appointments etc are easily found on the internet.
