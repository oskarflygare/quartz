# Key takeaways
* Rare de novo mutations like CNVs are non-specific and may be associated with schizophrenia, bipolar, autism, intellectual disability
* The presence of two X chromosomes in females has created a greater genomic robustness, they are less sensitive to genetic variation on the X chromosome.
	* This is probably why there is more variation in traits among males

Mental disorders are associated with reduced (evolutionary) fitness, so why do they persist? No single variant has a moderate or strong effect on risk, and only a sufficient number among the thousands of genetic variants underlying human behavior results in a mental disorder. This is called [[polygenic mutation-selection balance]].

Take-home messages:

- There is [[Equipotentiality]] in the genetics of psychiatric disorders. Many disorders can have the same genetic origin.
- Severe and early-onset cases may have de novo mutations
- There is a balance between mutation and selection: [[polygenic mutation-selection balance]]
- Overall burden is key
- Typically, what is inherited is not a disorder but a more general risk for psychopathology

> In summary, mutations in any of hundreds of different genes, involved in all kinds of molecular and cellular processes, and modified strongly by genetic background, can indirectly and non-specifically lead to altered trajectories of brain development that sometimes result in atypical outcomes that can manifest in diverse modes of psychopathology.
