## Advantages of a Zettelkasten
- It allows you to link notes together and connect ideas
- You can use notes for multiple projects, even if it's not instantly useful in a current project it can still have value down the road

## Each note has a fixed address

> The fixed address of each note is the alpha and omega of the world of Zettelkasten. Everything becomes possible because of it.

## One note = one idea
Notes need to be atomic, they contain "one idea and one idea only"

The notes contain:
1. A unique identifier
2. Body text, i.e. the piece of knowledge. ==USE YOUR OWN WORDS==
3. References

## What to write about?
This depends on your current projects and deadlines. You can choose to be more stringent if you need to focus on a specific projects, but allow yourself to stray a little bit. It might result in byproducts.

## Best practices of linking notes
Include an explanation *why* you are linking the note, be kind to your future self that discovers the note and it's links.
