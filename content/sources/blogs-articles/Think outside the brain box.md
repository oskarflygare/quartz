## Why and when I was reading this
It seemed interesting since I'm not delving into note-taking methods.

This is a book review of *The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain* by Annie Murphy Paul.

The book author thinks that our brains need help to offload things. For example we can speak and write to offload content and not having to remember it all at once. Cal Newport talks about it in [[Time management]].

One well-known technique is the method of loci.

It doesn't seem to be that much about actual systems for how to do this, the reviewer thinks the advice is quite plain with suggestions for group learning and "enacting concepts with our bodies".
