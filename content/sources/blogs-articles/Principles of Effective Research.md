# Key takeaways
* Effectiveness in research will in many ways resemble effectiveness in any other part of life.
* In the short term, focusing only on a research project while neglecting other parts of your life might lead to increased productivity. But it will be very bad in the long term.
* Focus on doing the basics well on a consistent basis.
* Take personal responsibility for your work. Don't blame teaching load, supervisors, students, lack of time.

> I believe that the foundation of effective research is to internalize a *strong vision* of what you want to achieve, to work *proactively* towards that vision, taking *personal responsibility* for successes and failures. You need to develop *disciplined* work habits, and to achieve balance between *self-development* and the actual *creative research process*.

# Three signs that you are not taking personal responsibility for your work

In the short-term it's easier to use these strategies rather than taking responsibility over the situation.

- Blaming external circumstances
- Doing busywork, often responding to emails quickly or helping others with "urgent" requests. See [[Success in academia leads to outside demands on your time and focus]]
- Beating yourself up, self-doubt/worry/overthinking

# Vision

- What sort of researcher would I like to become?
- What areas of research am I interested in?
	- How am I going to achieve competence in those areas?
	- Why are those areas interesting?
- How am I going to continue growing and expanding my horizons?
- How will I balance the long-term goals with the short-term realities of the situation I find myself in?

Dedicate time to develop and hone your vision, it will be a strong motivating factor when you run into issues along the way.

# Self-discipline

## Clarity: What, why, how

It's a lot easier to work hard on something if these three aspects are clear to you. Procrastination can stem from a lack of clarity in the *what*, *why* and/or *how*.

## Social environment

Find a group where you will be held accountable, that helps you develop research skills and research excellence. Take on students, collaborate, set up mentoring relationships.

## Honesty with yourself

His example was about time management and how a colleague realized he only spent 30 minutes per day on actual research.

# Self-development versus the creative process

If you focus only on self-development, you might exit the academic career too early because you don't feel like you are being treated well enough.

If you neglect self-development, you might end up publishing a lot of papers but you will stagnate in your own development.

> However, some people end up obsessed with writing as many papers as possible, as quickly as possible. While the short-term rewards of this are attractive (jobs, grants, reputation and prizes), the long-term costs are significant. In particular, it can lead to stagnation, and plateauing as a researcher.

If you manage to find a good balance between self-development and research output, you will produce enough to get and keep good jobs while also developing your talents and renewing yourself.

# Developing your strengths

You want to develop unique combinations of abilities, they will give you a comparative advantage over other people. If a new opens up which combines X and Y, a person that tries to really learn the other field will have an advantage.

> In any given research field there are usually only a tiny number of papers that are really worth reading. You are almost certainly better off reading deeply in the ten most important papers of a research field than you are skimming the top five hundred.

Going **deep** rather than **wide** again. [[Depth over width is the path forward for content creators]]. 

## Develop a high-quality research environment

You can start a seminar series, develop a discussion area, organize a small workshop, etc. If you can create the type of environment that promotes rather than hinders high quality research, it will help improve your own work as well.

## Developing a taste for what's important

- What are the characteristics of important science?
- What makes one area thrive, while another dies away?
- What sorts of unifying ideas are the most useful?
- What have been the most important developments in your field?
	- Why are they important?
- What were the apparently promising ideas that didn't pan out?
	- Why didn't they pan out?

If you have great taste, you can be honest with yourself about the quality and importance of your own work. [[Persistent effort will lead you to do work in line with your taste]]

[[The Hamming question]] can help you to focus on the most important problems and [[Working on the right question means aiming at the core of a problem]].

"Messy" fields that are hard to understand may point to possible unifying and simplifying concepts to be discovered.
