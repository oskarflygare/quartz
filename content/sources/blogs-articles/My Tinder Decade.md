## Highlights
- It’s possible Tinder didn’t do anything but promise us connection and we’re the ones who decided how we wanted to connect.
- Still, it’s impossible not to see myself on an attractiveness scale determined by Tinder and to wonder if what I find attractive is modulated by the matches I am “good enough” for.
- Urban planners call these “desire paths,” well-worn ribbons of foot traffic in the terrain that are “a consequence of the usage of the shortest route to a destination.”
