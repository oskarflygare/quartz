# Key takeaways
* Through synthesis you can construct a new point of view or conclusion based on a set of observations
* Multiple things going on at the same time (very much like Luhmann’s Zettelkasten)
* We want to re-use and remix ideas from the past

> This is a future that I want: a research group can confidently aim their sights at a complex, interdisciplinary problem area, and construct an effective synthesis together with minimal “busywork overhead”

# Conceptual model

## Question notes

Express an open research question

## Synthesis notes

Express a single, generalized idea (e.g., a claim)

## Observation notes

Express a single, highly contextualized and specific observation. Many observation notes can form a synthesis note

## Context snippet

To ground and contextualize observation notes
