# Key takeaways
* Look for these traits in academic collaborators: Contributes to work, fun to work with, has the same ambition. You can also try to fulfil these three aspects yourself when you are the collaborator.
* Who am I? I think I can come off as a bit grumpy at times, particularly over video conferencing. If I worked on that part I think the other two are OK, perhaps it is also a good idea to explicitly discuss the goals of a project.
