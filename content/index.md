# About me
## Work

I'm a post-doc and licensed psychologist working in the [Bjureberg/Hellner](https://ki.se/cns/johan-bjureberg-och-clara-hellners-forskargrupp?ref=oskarflygare.com) and [RÃ¼cklab](https://rucklab.com/?ref=oskarflygare.com) research groups at Karolinska Institutet.

My research aims to understand suicide and self-injury, the psychological mechanisms involved and how to treat those difficulties.

Other research interests include the psychological treatment of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, particularly internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT).

## Outside of work

I play keyboard and saxophone in my band [Division 7](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3z6F8NIRs126ddMywopmfP?si=JqEHsYkXShGriY1kaCsEaw&ref=oskarflygare.com), DJ and give public presentations every now and then.
