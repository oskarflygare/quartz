# About me
## Work

I'm a post-doc and licensed psychologist working in the [Bjureberg](https://ki.se/cns/johan-bjurebergs-forskargrupp) and [RÃ¼cklab](https://rucklab.com/?ref=oskarflygare.com) research groups at Karolinska Institutet.

My research aims to understand [[Suicide]] and self-injury, the psychological mechanisms involved and how to treat those difficulties.

Other research interests include the psychological treatment of [[OCD]], [[BDD]], [[ASD]] and other disorders, often through internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT).

## Outside of work

I play keyboard and saxophone in my band [Division 7](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3z6F8NIRs126ddMywopmfP?si=JqEHsYkXShGriY1kaCsEaw&ref=oskarflygare.com), DJ and give public presentations every now and then.
